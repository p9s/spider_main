The band at the bottom does a great job of supporting the breast, and I'm not really sure if the next size up would have done that.

B01IN6CMTE	Good value	I love the longer biking capris and was excited to try these out after they arrived. I'm tall (5'9") and these are plenty long. One thing I noticed is that the elastic stays put at the bottom of the legs, so to pull them up into the correct position I had to pull up the bottoms first and pull them on like a pair of tights. Also while riding I noticed that the waistband rolled down, which may be the fault of the rider's body and not a design flaw. Overall these are a good value.The rear cushioning tends to be located back farther which would work better for an upright rider. Those who lean forward may find the padding a little thin in front.	catenbrink	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B01IN6COMO	/gp/pdp/profile/A33QUT75RF0G3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/07/19

I'm 5'6.5" at. 150, slender hops and thighs.Having said that, they flop down very easily and almost not worth wearing aside from the cushioning in the seat. It does make riding for 3 hours more comfy but the sliding down issue doesn't help.  I guess one needs to really assess their body type before ordering larger than one's regular size.

B01IN6CMTE	Overall a good product	I love the fit and quality of the pants, the only thing I would change is the stitching in the crotch area. I'm not sure what kind of thread was used to sew the padding into the pants, but it is quite abrasive when walking. Thankfully I don't feel the stitching when seated on a bike.

B01IN6CMTE	Excellent quality!	Based on other reviews I purchased a large rather than my usual medium. They were a bit large, so I paln to return for a medium, which I expect to "fit as expected".These are extremely comfortable and I am very impressed with the quality. The fabric is substantial (I don't like see through knickers!) the pad is thick, but does not bulge like other cycling shorts I have had. It looks smooth on the back. On top of all this, you can't beat the great price!	Maria	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B01IN6CL3Q	/gp/pdp/profile/A11S0M9EEFNRPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	5	2016/10/25

B01IN6CMTE	Comfortable and good price	Overall they are comfortable and I like that come up higher so that during spinning they do not slip down.  They run a little small, and based on recommendations from the reviews, I went up a size.  Which I'm glad I did.  they are not too bulky and I feel comfortable walking around in public with them, and not worrying about the back end.  For the use in spin class, they work fine.  I have not used many other types of padded bike pants, this brand is my first.  I use them 1-2 times a week.  Styling is simple, which I like.  I wash on gentle and hang to dry.

B01CVBU9NI	Huge Chamois	The chamois is oddly huge, even in the extra small.  It ends up buckling, which causes chafing on long rides.  I have these relegated to "20 miles and under" rides.

B01CVBU9NI	Good for the money. Excellent design work. Well made shorts but very thin chamois.	All in all these are good bibs for the money. Especially considering how difficult it is to find decent women's bibs for less than a whole paycheck. If they change the chamois to a thicker one I will be first in line to buy a dozen more. The pair I have though, despite being pretty new, is slated for a chamois replacement for more padding.The good:Some of the best breathing fabric I've ever had shorts out of. Absolute gold star. Doing any kind of indoor cycling? These are what you want.Very well made. Nice high quality flatlock stitching including on that oh so important seam that goes along the inner thigh and under the chamois.Design of the elastic gripper at the bottom of the leg is good. Lets the fabric expand properly so you don't get that cutting into you feeling while still keeping things in place.Fit is fantastic. Purchased a large, fits perfectly. Straps might be just a hair short but I have an unusually long torso and I'm sure they'll stretch with use. No complaints. Fabric also stays nice and opaque. No transparency issues even with my large trackie thighs.The neutral:The chamois stays in place while riding. I mean doesn't move a millimeter. It's impressive. I either really love that or really don't depending when you ask me.There is a bit of a hard ridge where the 2 chamois sections (pink & black) meet, although it didn't cause me a problem. Best I can tell the pink part is glued on to the black somehow so you don't have that old problem with a bunch of stitching at a horrible spot because they needed to connect sections.The less good:The chamois is very thin. It seems more like a triathlon chamois than a regular cycling one. Might work well for those who use really soft saddles (or do very short rides) but with the hard racing ones I use less so. Honestly if it were just thicker I'd probably leave it be and use the shorts as is, but it really is that thin.There is very little give in the chamois. This is not a stretchy one like a Castelli chamois. There is some stretch in the black part (which does help a lot) but the pink part is pretty rigid.

B01CVBU9NI	Good fit - no camel toe - adequate padding	Technical details: I'm 5'5" 140#. I purchased a size medium and they were a perfect fit. The bottom seams have grippers to keep it from riding up. The suspenders are made of light mesh that is very breathable. The padding is adequate in the front and ample in the rear.Other details: I broke my own rule of not trying anything new on an organized ride and I happily didn't regret it. I have purchased this brand once before and really liked it, so I gambled on breaking this in on a group ride. This garment also resisted forming a camel toe.

B01CVBU9NI	Nice price. Okay bibs. Not great for me. Update: I really really like them!	After wearing Pearl Izumi shorts for a year, and being very happy with those, I bought these as my first bibs.The run a little big, so if you're a small in Pearl Izumi, go for a x-small. (I'm size S and bought S) The padding is somewhat narrow and for me that means it rubs a bit against my inner thigh. I'm hoping this will get better when worn and washed more. I doubt I can used to the chamois being this thin compared to what I'm used to and I probably won't go for a long ride in these (I've only worn these on two 12mile rides so far)They feel very comfortable and soft, but I don't appreciate the lack of tummy tuck. I look a lot more slim in my normal chamois shorts. So now I'm looking for bibs with more support in that area.The price is good. No sausage legs. If you don't mind the lack of tummy tuck and a smaller chamois they'll be just fine.Update: I've had these for awhile now. I ride about 5 times a week. I've become really happy with these! Have worn them on 30K and no problems! I would buy again.	Senshin	Size: X-Large	B01CVBUAIW	/gp/pdp/profile/A11FWM47UFR1DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	4	2016/06/10

I am training for a 7day ride down the coast of California and ordered a total of 9 pairs of shorts in order to, ideally, have one pair for each day. I wish I had just ordered 7 of these. Even though bib shorts make certain things more dificult, they are so confortable and I love not having the presure on my waist. I did a 75 mile training ride yesterday and these were so comfortable! Would order them again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended.	Anda T Ambrosini	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A2J8Q4DCHIDAP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	5	2016/05/30

B00VA2O9UE	I'm delighted with the Fit!!	Fabulous Fit!!!  I was a bit nervous ordering my first bike cover for my new electric bike and really studied the specs.  Even with all the research I was amazed at the fabulois fit!!  I am using this cover on my bike in my garage for now, but will be using it a lot when I take the bike out with my small RV for trips this spring and summer.  My bike is electric and I'm quite nervous about theft...So in addition to ordering very secure bike locks I got this cover to hide the bike while I am traveling and at RV parks.  Thus far great product and I am very pleased.  For those interested in size, my electric bike is 70 inches, 24 inch wheels and 24 inch cruiser handlebars.  The "drop" is spot on - but I imagine taller bikes will show some wheels.	Amazon Customer	Color: Black	B00VA2O9UE	/gp/pdp/profile/AY9QXWFMF73VB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2017/03/22

B00VA2O9UE	Ok	Works well. I use these for bikes in storage. A couple of folding bikes (so these offer more than enough coverage) and a full size commuter bike. They can be difficult to get on and off if (like me) there are a lot of things attached to the bike (lights, fenders, computer...) as they all tend to snag. When fully covering my full sized bike, it is a tight fit but is achievable with some stretching/maneuvering.

B00VA2O9UE	Great protection from the weather and as a theft deterent	I love this cover. I have a hybrid bike which I have on a rack on my patio. I've been using this cover all summer here in Minnesota where we've had a record breaking amount of rain and not a single drop has gotten in.For those that can't tell by the pictures, it doesn't close fully at the bottom. It has more of an elastic type feel to it though, so it does seem to get a better fit to it than you would think.It comes with a clip on one side (the back) and two holes (the front) for which you can use to secure it down. I use the clip in the back to secure it to the bike below mine in the rack and the holes to snake through a lock to deter people from taking it off.I live in a metropolitan area and I really believe that having the cover on my bike has REALLY helped it from theft threats. Out of sight out of mind sort of thing. I also have other locks on it, but the first defense for it is this cover.I'm actually looking forward to this coming winter to see how it will fair against the Minnesota cold. So far, though, so good. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking. I am myself even considering purchasing a second one for my girlfriend's bike---just for the weather protecting aspect.

B00VA2O9UE	Takes the cake on price + quality!	I've had a few different bike covers over the years and this one definitely takes the cake for price/quality ratio! When they say heavy duty, they mean heavy duty -- I'm just using it on my electric bicycle, but I can definitely see this being high enough quality for a motorcycle. I love the straps to ensure it stays on (and doesn't flap in the breeze like my last cover!) and I can see the rivet-reinforced holes being great for areas where theft is a possibility. The little orange tabs on the handlebars serve as an easy way of getting it off in the morning and also help you to know which way is forward. All in all, it was a great purchase and I'd happily recommend it to anyone!	Michelle Salemka	Color: Black	B00VA2O9UE	/gp/pdp/profile/A3B4FKWJMX6AFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2016/08/28

B00VA2O9UE	Nice cover	I was surprised how well this covered the bike. It was very easy to put on and take off. Great for if your putting it on at the start of a shower and are trying to hurry. Seams were well made. The elastic and clips were good to help keep it in place in wind and storm. It hasn't been rained on yet so I don't know how well it will keep off water. But if it does leak any it's an easy fix with a trip to the camping section. It's light weight good for packing in a backpack when your riding around campus. I wish it had a second lock grommet in the back or middle so it's easier to run the lock over the frame too. With a cable lock its not impossible though. This was bought to cover my bike at college where it must be kept on an outside rack. Most of the bikes there were pretty rusted from being outside. I will let you know how it holds up. It comes with a bag but it is tight fit. I had a little trouble getting it in and out wish either it had a little give to it or was just a bit bigger. I may just end up using a camping stuff bag  for it. One word of advice to any product like this is if you pack it up with any wetness on it dew, rain ,snow make sure you let it air dry asap be case it will mold and stink.

B00VA2O9UE	Great heavy duty bike cover	This is a great bicycle cover! I had bought a cheaper cover and it ripped in just a few months. When I pulled this one out of the bag I could tell it was much more heavy duty. It has held up much better, it has only been a few months but it is showing none of the wear and tear or fading of the previous cover. It is definitely worth spending a bit more for this cover in the first place rather than having to replace a cheaper one.

B00VA2O9UE	Easy to use and does the trick	Definitely meets my needs.  I bought this to cover my bike while it's on the back of my car so it doesn't get wet or exposed to sun.I used to ride my bike before work and then walk it inside the building to avoid exposure to sun and rain all day while I was at work.  This allows me to quickly cover it up and avoid the hassle.  It's easy to put on and stays in place because of the elastic.  I haven't tried driving with the cover on because my bike is mounted on a back rack and I don't think this is designed for that.  When the cover isn't in use I just wad it up throw it in the back of my car, it is very light weight and easy to scrunch into a ball.

B00VA2O9UE	Great bike cover	Great bike cover. Sad that it doesn't fit over my bike cruiser completely. It leaves the front tire partially uncovered but should protect most of it from sun and water damage. Thankfully it doesn't rain too much in San Diego. It's good quality and I like that there are holes for cord locks. It's not that great for my large U-bar lock but thankfully I can just lock the back tire to the frame and cover it in my storage area. So if I do buy the cord lock in the future it will fit in perfectly. I do like the reflective feature that shows the part of the tarp that needs to go over the handlebars.

Wind hasn't been a problem. The only thing I have to fault with it is the bicycle lock holes for the mountain bike being used with it basically just lets you lock the front tire. Well, if your front tire has a quick release, this sort of defeats the purpose as it would be really easy to snag the frame and leave the front tire with the cover.

B00VA2O9UE	Best Value. I have many tried others.	Update: nearly two years of daily use the four season North East. Still repels water fairly well just some wear along the bottom where my studed winter tires made contact. My bike looks a thousand times better than when I used to lock it up uncovered.This cover is like twenty bucks. People whining about it not being perfect are ridiculous. Its twenty bucks for crying out loid. If you want something more robust get out your wallet spend more for a heavier grade canvas. This is intended for portability, somethint you throw in your backpack and ride away with...good theft deterrence too.-------------------------------------------------I have two seasons using various Amazon covers for daily use. The first one, Bike Parka for $50 tore after 8 months along the bottom. The second Bike Parka was stolen off my bike,  no one's fault. The third Bike Parka has ripped once again along the bottom. $150 later I decided to try something else. This Baleaf cover arrived and immediately I'm impressed with the two reflective pull tabs that go over the handlebar section. That's smart.. makes it easy and quick to figure out which side goes in front. The fabric is still lightweight like the Bike Parka but has a finish that seems far more water repelling. This makes me think that I can shake most of the water off the cover before I fold it up and put it in my Chrome Cargo messenger bag without finding a bunch of water in my bag. I use the cover daily at a bike rack partly to camouflage the bike from passers-by who would otherwise notice the flashy paint scheme and potentially mess with it. Let's see how this cover fares this winter now that temps have fallen below 50 for the first time. So far I'm very impressed with quality and fit.update: we had a mild winter but the cover still looks great after being out in the elements day in and day out. Its still water repelling and I wish purchased it sooner. This is a bargain for the price. So I'm ordering a second one to use indoors.

B00VA2O9UE	A little over a year later: This cover is falling apart. :(	Update: I've now had this for a year and a half. We only use the bike when we have company who want to ride it... maybe four times a year. So the cover doesn't get much on-and-off action. I dropped it from five stars to one star. Why? It's starting to get holes in it. Sure, the sun is a brutal mistress, but this "heavy duty" cover just can't handle it. A little less a year after purchase and any part of the cover that was sun-facing has gone from dark black to bright gray/white. What's worse: there are little holes starting, and I know they'll be big holes soon. This cover will be a pile of tatters soon. I will need a new cover, and I will not be buying this one again.Use: San Diego. Not much rain. But plenty of sun. ...I don't have faith that this would hold up to the elements anywhere, to be honest.Original review follows.I've had this cover for about a month. So far it seems to stand up to the Southern California sun. It adequately protects a full-size mountain bike. The grommets/holes for a lock are convenient and appreciated.

B00VA2O9UE	I tried a different cover last season and it tore ...	I tried a different cover last season and it tore within a few weeks.  This cover seems durable.  It is a little snug at the front but can be slightly manipulated since it does have a little extra room at the rear.  Straightening the front wheel helps. I'm using this to cover a girl's 26" Panama Jack beach cruiser bike.  After a little maneuvering, I was able to get the bike covered in its entirety.  I gave it 4 stars since it is a little snug and I haven't had it long enough to know if it will last for a while.

B00VA2O9UE	96% satisfied	Well, I don't think I could have found a better one for the price, but was disappointed that this cover would not fully cover my cruiser bike all the way to the ground like the one in the picture.  I have to leave my bike outside, and really wanted a cover that would completely cover my bike so that no rain would splash up off the ground onto my bike.  It goes down all the way on the back tire, but not on the front, I've got about 4 inches exposed in the front.  I have big cruiser handlebars that I'm guessing were not the intended type to go under this cover.  The material is strong and sturdy, waterproof, and has a clip to secure the cover in front of the back tire, and grommets in the front. I supposed it could be secured for use when you have your bike on a carrier, but I don't use it for that.  I love the design, quality, color, and features, if it just had another 4 inches of reach in the front, I would be 100% satisfied, but as it is, I'm only 96% happy, which is still better than I could get anywhere else. =)	Heather Baker	Color: Camouflage	B00NUYL6GK	/gp/pdp/profile/A1ANE0PZ0HKRHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	21	4	2015/01/27

B01N322V5I	Perfect Low to Medium Impact Sports Bra	This is my new go-to sports bra for yoga and lifting. I wouldn't probably wear it for running or cardio without sizing down. I'm probably between a small and medium, so I went with medium, not wanting the dreaded boobie smash. Because of that, the bra is probably slightly less supportive than it would be if it fit perfectly, but it's still great. Comfortable and as supportive as I need it to be for the activities I wear it to. Doesn't hurt that it's really cute with that cross back design, too!	whit	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B01N6P1XKP	/gp/pdp/profile/A15EH7HT11C00G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2017/05/04

The sleeves have sewn in holes for your thumbs which I love since it keeps my hands warm.  The material is not see through at all.

The stitching around the thumb holes are well sewn so it doesn't look like it'll rip from frequent use.

B01MED55QQ	Good material and I like the fit	This is a very nice shirt, good marteial and fit. I typically wear xs or s (5'2" and 118), but I ordered a medium due to my experiences with other shirts. The medium is a perfect fit for me -- not too tight but enough fit to show body. My suggestion is to be honest with yourself on what fit of shirt you like and are comfortable with before buying. If you like tight, then order your regular size, but if you like a little forgiving fit then order up.	Tisha M.

B071H8LRNP	Inexpensive alternative to the Columbia PFG travel and sport shirts	I have a Columbia PFG sunblock long sleeved shirt in light pink, and I really liked it to wear to flea markets and to the pool to keep from getting sunburned. I saw this brand and thought I'd give it a try. My Columbia is a 1X size shirt, but it's a little tight when snapped closed, so I ordered the Baleaf in a size 2X in white. Well, their 2X fits like Columbia's 1X. Next, I compared materials; the Columbia has a ripstop nylon vented shell. The Baleaf has a plain nylon vented shell. It is not as soft as the Columbia either, but I might chalk that up to the fact I've had the Columbia for several years. I wore the Baleaf shirt in the hot summer sun on a humid day to a flea market. The day heated up pretty quickly, and soon I was sweating. After about three hours, I changed from the Baleaf to the Columbia for a comparison and went the rest of the day in the Columbia shirt. I felt cooler and drier in the Columbia, so I think that the Columbia is better at wicking away moisture and keeping the wearer cooler as a result. On the plus side, I did not burn in either shirt.So if you're looking for an inexpensive sunblock shirt for traveling or camping, this one may be for you. If you're busty, order it in a larger size, and if it's super humid, you may not be as dry as in another shirt.	karenrz	Color: White|Size: XX-Large	B072DWFHTM	/gp/pdp/profile/A3C1NMV0WQQ4VJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	3	2017/07/18

B01AZ3KJE8	Horrible quality and sizing issues (DO NOT BUY)	I'm 6'0" and range in weight between 185-190 lbs. with an athletic build and bought a large based on some of the other reviews.The first two runs in these tights were perfect, but after one washing and laying out to dry these tights have never fit properly again. The elastic waist band is still tight, and remains so for the first quarter mile, but after that they begin to migrate from my waist down my butt. To be clear the fit around my thighs and calves is still a compression fit as I struggle to pull any fabric away from my skin, but I cannot run in these tights despite the fact that they fit the rest of my body well. MaybeAs for cold weather running, the three runs (~5 miles each) I was actually able to wear these tights for were at approximately 38, 43, and 45 degrees F and I was plenty warm which was a nice surprise since these are first and foremost compression tights. But, unfortunately, as stated above, run three came with some unexpected waist management issues. By the fourth run I had to turn around after a half mile due to the simple fact that managing the failing waist band was impossible.A medium may solve the issue, but I worry that a medium wouldn't fit my legs (I cycle quite a bit and have medium to large thighs and calves for my size--not body builder large, just think avid cycling size). At present I would not recommend these to anyone.  For background, I'm an avid gear head and love my trail runs, mountaineering, and cycling and am accustomed to buying clothing for layers and specific workouts.

The tights come all the way down to the bottom of my ankles and up to my waistline where they should be.  The material is a bit thinner than my other orange tights (different brand) but keep me warm and since they are thinner they don't get as hot on warmer spring mornings when I can't decide if I should wear tights or not on some mornings.  I love their bright color!  I wear these under my bike shorts or normal gym shorts.  I'm giving these 4 star because there's no crotch pouch.  Not a big deal but my orange tights (different brand) have a crotch pouch which is a bit more comfortable.

Instead, I tied off thread and have been wearing them - defect was very minor and did not diminish the leggings' functionality). After posting this review, however, Baleaf very kindly reached out to me to remedy the situation, which is pretty great of them.

B01B18LDCS	They felt great. Even though the fabric was on the thin ...	I started getting serious about weightlifting awhile back so I bought a cheap pair of 3/4 length compression shorts to wear on leg day. They felt great. Even though the fabric was on the thin side, they made my muscles feel primed and ready to go. So I knew I had to get a few more pairs. I didn't want to shell out the money for Under Armor or Nike since my cheap pair got the job done, but I didn't want to go all in on a brand I'd never tried before. So I tried several. I bought a pair from Baleaf, Tesla, and SUB. All were full length except for the Baleaf pair which was 3/4. Thus far they've all been great and are significant improvements over my first pair. My only complaint is that the waistband on the Baleaf is too thin and will occasionally slide down a bit. If I had to pick one I'd probably go with SUB. It has fewer seams and is less restrictive. The Tesla is more breathable however and gave me just the right amount of length whereas the SUB was a tad long. Still, the overall comfort I receive from my SUBs is enough to give it the edge. It's a great buy.	Tim M.	Color: Navy|Size: Medium	B01B18M1YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A3VMCNM7DS03DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	3	2017/01/02

B01B18LDCS	Comfortable! And Excellent Service!	Comfortable, but it didn't provide enough compression for my liking. Also, be sure to hand wash it first. It bleeds color like crazy - i put it in the sink and the water turned pitch black. Without first hand washing, it'll either stain your other clothes in the wash or your skin while working out.UPDATE 1/4/17:Baleaf contacted me and offered a replacement. Though new pair had similar compression, their customer relations was excellent, which I highly value in a company! Great job retaining me as a customer!

The 3/4 length tights fit well.  Length is not too long for 3/4 length. The material is thick enough not to have to wear shorts over top of the tights.  Waist did not roll over even though there was no internal draw string.  Have washed once partially dried in the dryer and lined fully dry.  No shrinkage after first wash.  Have worn to the gym twice. Not as much support as full running tights but gave enough support and warmed muscles better than short tights. I usally switch from short tights to full running tights in the fall.  Baleaf 3/4 length will give another option when weather/gym is not too cold. Will be getting at least another pair.  Paired with UA victory II tank will sure to become regular gym wear for the fall.

I should mentioned though that I do wear shorts over them, since I am not comfortable just wearing them by themselves. I noticed that when I wear them by legs and knees can run for longer without feeling as tired as without them.11/25/2016 Update: I returned to buy more of this 3/4 compression since it has been getting colder for my morning runs. I love this brand, again, the quality for the price is amazing. I probably should mentioned on previous review, that you can wear them without shorts, since the material is good enough to provide coverage. Anyway, I got two more and will get more as soon as the other colors become available.

B01B18LDCS	Sizing feels off, but its ok I guess.	UPDATE:  Wore for a yoga session and, to put it simply, I was not held in place.  I bought a pair of "Tesla" branded bottoms that fit MUCH better -- and were cheaper.

Waist is a little loose and the front panel is a little loose also, it isn't 'supportive'. I prefer my athletic wear to be on the compressive side and this doesnt feel compressive anywhere.  Stitching is missing in a few spots, a few bad cuts also.For the price, they are disposable.  Its nice to find some colors in 3/4 length mens tights.

B01B18LDCS	Men's leggings! (meggings)	These are comfortable. My very first pair of this sort of thing. I can see why ladies wear them. Dead simple. Cheap. Comfy. That being said, men's fashion does not currently have meggings within the orthodoxy. Expect to polarize people. To help you in your selections, I've included some excerpts of responses in my first couple days of wearing them. From women only. No men have offered unsolicited feedback as of this writing.One woman said that she "couldn't stop staring at my junk" during dinner.Another laughed when she saw me and repeatedly asked "Why-y-y?"Yet another said that she would not be seen with me in public while I was wearing them.In my defense, my junk is not well defined, save for a nondescript lump as I am using undergarments. These adhere well to your body and won't shift easily (or slide of your rear while bending over. They're flexible enough to do yoga in. Great stuff.

B01MS8Z3O6	Probably need a size down for borderline waist size.	Update: 7/6/17+1 star for customer service!It can be frustrating purchasing non-returnable clothing such as underwear.  I'm not our for free undies, I just want undies that fit great and won't leave me chafed from a leisurely day of hiking/running because they don't fit right.I was surprised to be contacted by the vendor/customer service last night (same night of review, and it wasn't a horrible review) and offered a partial refund.  I accepted, but counter-offered that instead of a partial refund i'd be happy to try a pair of the smaller size down to see if it's just the size, or if it's my body type that isn't compatible.  They accepted.So, regardless, even if the size down still fits weird, I have to thank the company for reaching out to me on their own, and quickly, and also for being accommodating and understanding.I'll update a final review again after trying the size down, but either way, the customer service here was great. Thank you guys.---Original 3 star Review on 7/5/17---I am 5'6" 140lbs, 32" waist.Based on the size chart I ordered a medium.+ for tag-less.  This is actually very nice.- The medium fits to be sure, but the waist (and waistband) seem to pull up very high before the goods are secured in the pouch, close to my belly button, to the point I almost look like i'm wearing granny panties.Maybe I have a shorter torso than most, but this is a little annoying. My leggings ride on my hips, so if I wear these boxer briefs and no shirt, you'd see an inch or two of underwear above the pants waistline.Other brands seem to state ordering a size down due to the stretchiness of 90/10 poly/spandex so maybe that's what I should have done.instead of buying another pair at a smaller waist size I decided to try out a different brand instead that has 3 pair for the same price and same review score.

B00PVXN4KO	Goo dof COLD weather, a bit tight.	Purchased these to run in low winter Wisconsin temperatures (20-30 degrees).  Used them first time when the wind was blowing a bit strong (15+ MPH) so the cold managed to get through on a 5 miler.  But, with low wind, at temps down to 25 or so I was very satisfied.My only negative is that they are definitely tight, especially at the knees.  They loosen up a bit once you start moving around, but there is tightness when bending the knee at first.

B00PVXN4KO	Runs Small! - After getting a size larger, they are good!	For the price you can't beat it, compared to Nike and Asics, etc. However, make sure you order one size larger. I typically wear small in tights from 95% of manufacturers. These run small. I am going to exchange them and see how they are and will update the review... UPDATE: I returned them and bought a new pair in size medium and they fit perfectly. I like the reflective portions on these tights. I will probably wear these hiking and running as they make me visible.	diesel85	Size: Small	B0154FRD8W	/gp/pdp/profile/AAYSP3BQSEGHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/03/22
B00PVXN4KO	This is definitely a skinny fit, so if you're tall and very lean these would be great for frosty morning runs!	I gave this product 3 stars as I don't think it's bad, it just the fit suits tall lanky types. I'm 5'10" 180 lbs and I have lean legs. My mid thigh is about 21". I ordered the medium and I could not get these half way over my thigh. They have little to no stretch. The material it medium to heavy weight and they do feel very warm. Length wise they seem right but to get a fit I think I would need to order a large, which I think would suit a 6" plus bean stalk. I've returned them and will keep looking....I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. I've a very average size and these are not average fit.

B00PVXN4KO	The back is quite low cut and not at all like some other brand cycling tights	I'm 6'0 and 165lbs, normal legs etc. I ordered these in a large for cycling use over my padded shorts. These things are plenty tight and might not be usable for cycling. The back is quite low cut and not at all like some other brand cycling tights. I can hardly fit them over my shorts. They do look like they would be fine for running, however. I had read other reviews saying they were too long, but not so with these.  In fact, they are barely long enough.This could be a quality control problem, I don't know. The quality and warmth seems fine for under twenty bucks.  If you are a whippet thin runner these should be just fine, but for us normal folks they're a little too snug. I'll probably try to make these work and with luck they will stretch a little with use. If I could swing $120.00 for tights I would certainly rather support my LBS and make sure I was getting the right thing,so I guess I can,t complain too much about a $18.00 internet order.

B00PVXN4KO	Incredible value, but possible quality control issue	The Baleaf Men's Thermal Cycling Tights are a good value for the price I paid ($19.99). I have a similar, much more expensive pair of running tights with similar features (Sugoi Zap Midzero) which I love, and this product compares favorably. I'd say it has 90% the functionality and comfort at a much lower cost.Size M fits me well. I usually wear 31 waist x 30 inseam pants.Fabric is slightly thinner, and stretchier than the fabric used in the Zap Midzero. It's comfy and warm.Back zipper pocket is huge. I was able to cram in 6 gels without stretching it too much. It can easily fit my Samsung S6 w/ case.However, there are a few minor things I dislike.1) Included drawstring is bulky and too long. I think a thinner string that is a few inches shorter would be ideal. Not really a problem for me because I usually remove them anyway.2) Ankle zippers perfectly functional, but don't lay completely flat. They buckle a tiny bit as if they were just a tad too long. This is primarily a cosmetic issue.3) Biggest issue: One ankle opening is slightly wider than the other. The right one is perfectly flush all around my ankle, and in left one I can stick a whole finger through without stretching the fabric. It's a bit annoying, but doesn't affect comfort or function. I suspect this may be a quality control issue. (see attached photo)These tights are an amazing value at $20, but I have to dock a star for a minor quality control issue.	kev	Size: M	B00PVXN4KO	/gp/pdp/profile/A2HCB7G96572MV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	4	2017/02/18

B00PVXN4KO	Durability is the only downfall for this product...	I really like the product, looks and feels good on you. It is a bit just enough to give you gentle compression and does shield you from the elements (I cycle a lot in cold, I wore these when the temps were in upper 20's F) and they do a great job at that. Not really much to complain about except durability.I really like the little pocket (with zipper) on the back for your keys or small items. I wear these when I go cycling under my cycling shorts when its pretty cold outside and also for running.

B00PVXN4KO	Good tights for running, with just one small disappointment	I bought these to replace my Nike Dri-Fits, which have worked well for a couple of years, but are a little too light for brisk Northern California runs (yeah, I'm a wimp). After a few runs, I've decided that they are exactly the right weight, and the fleece-ish lining feels good.After reading some of the comments about sizing, I decided to order XXL--I'm 6'2" and just a bit over 200 lbs. The fit is just right. I do notice that compared to my Nikes, they are very low-rise. That just takes a little getting used to, because they feel different from my older tights. The waistband is wide (good thing) and fits comfortably (my waist is 36").I did have one small disappointment--I always run with my phone (Galaxy S6). I was hoping that the back pocket would be large enough to accommodate it so I could leave my small fanny pack home. No dice, so the fanny pack stays with me. Not a deal breaker--but I'm curious why the manufacturers of all tights like these don't size the back pockets to hold a phone.Overall, I'm very happy with these and can recommend them. The price is right, they fit well and the white trim looks pretty spiffy.	J.M. Parsons	Size: XX-Large	B00PVXNFL2	/gp/pdp/profile/AY98Q3TMTOTZF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2017/01/19

B00PVXN4KO	Quality tights, great price	First, I want to acknowledge Baleaf's excellent customer service. I had previously purchased a pair of their windproof tights which ended up being too small. Free of charge they sent me the next size up and were very friendly in helping me return the other pair. Five stars for customer service! Now for a review of the thermal cycling tights...I primarily use these tights for running. I live in Minnesota and my goal this year is to run throughout the winter. I have been running in these tights for the past month. As far as warmth goes, they are excellent. So far I have run in these tights down to 15 degrees (Fahrenheit) and they kept my legs warm. They aren't windproof, but my legs don't get very cold when I run and this hasn't been an issue for me. The fleece lining on the inside feels great. I wouldn't hesitate to wear these tights on their own even a little below 15 degrees. I haven't had a chance to do so yet, but will attempt to do it soon. When it comes to warmth, I would give these tights 5 stars.The build quality of these tights is also excellent. They feel durable. The fleece keeps me warm. The vents on the back of the legs are well placed. I don't ever feel like I overheat in the tights, either. I have run in them up to 40 degrees and they have still been comfortable. These tights look and feel like a quality product and for only $20 you can't go wrong. Five stars for build quality.Sizing is the only complaint I have. And it's a pretty minor complaint. The more I've worn them, the more I've gotten used to them. However, the issue I have with them is similar to the issue I had with the windproof version and that's how tight they are in the calf area. I am about 5'10" and 150lbs and am a relatively skinny guy. I don't have particularly large calves, and maybe I'm not used to wearing quality tights (I've had some cheap ones over the years), but they are definitely snug around the calves. I bought two sizes (medium and large) to see if one felt better than the other. The large felt a little more comfortable in the calves, but the two sizes were very similar. The only other issue I have is that the stitching behind the knees for the vents is a little annoying at times. It is located in a spot that is a little uncomfortable. Neither of these things are major issues, and overall I really like the tights and would recommend them to anyone looking for a warm pair of tights for winter running.I actually ended up keeping both the medium and the large because both fit me relatively well. I primarily wear the medium pair when I run and use the large pair for layering when I'm out hiking in the cold.	dbricks	Size: Large	B00PVXN7SS	/gp/pdp/profile/AGVSVYGOGIAPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2017/01/04
B00PVXN4KO	Good, not great, but more than worth what I paid.	Wore them for the first time today for a run. Temp was about 23 F with a little wind. For me, that's probably about the lower limit for runs less than an hour without wearing something else too. And I'll probably wear some compression shorts under them below about 30 F from now on to be a little more comfortable and for more wind protection, and definitely for longer runs.As far as fit, I'm 6'2" with 33.5" inseam, currently 180 lbs and 33 in waist. I ordered large. They fit fine around the waist. They're about 1.5" short, on me. I gained a little weight after about 8 months away from running dealing with illness. As I get back into shape and if I make it back to 165-170 lbs and 32" waist, I expect the waist might be slightly loose, but the drawstring should make up for that. I don't think the legs will really get any looser on me though, as I definitely lost muscle mass in my legs while sick. If anything, I'm more worried that they'll be even tighter if I can regain that muscle. I'll try to update this review If anything changes.I can't speak to durability yet. The quality seems good. I have a couple Baleaf compression longs sleeve shirts that have held up well, and these seem comparable so far.I like the rubber around the inside of of the ankle to keep them from riding up. The zipper at the ankle seams like a nice feature, though I'm not sure if I'll really need it. They fit fine going on over my feet. It could make it easier to take them off when they're wet. I like the zipper pocket in the back. I have some shorts with the same kind of pocket, and it comes in handy for keys, id, a little food, etc. The pocket is not big enough for a smartphone. You could probably fit about 4 gels, give or take, or a bar or 2 in there. I don't have any gels or bars on hand, so it's just an estimate. A small camera will also fit. The camera I tried is 3.5" x 2.25" x 0.75". The zipper opening is about 3.75". The pocket extends at a taper about 3.5" in each direction past the openingUpdate Feb 15, 2017: I really like the ankles zippers. It makes it a lot easier to take them off when wet from running in the rain. Unzipping them also makes it easy to roll up to above the knees when I start to get too warm. Zipped and rolled, they'd be too tight and cut off some circulation. Not too tight rolled up unzipped.  Durability seems to be pretty good. I did put a hole in one pair. I tripped and scraped my knee. Better the tights than my knee, I guess. But I've worn that pair a number of times since putting the hole in them, and the hole has not gotten any bigger.	tospol	Size: Large	B00PVXN7SS	/gp/pdp/profile/A9WY6LYCD2RO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	4	2017/01/03

B00PVXN4KO	Great product...even better price!	I've purchased two pair of these over the last month for my son who runs in them.  He has run in these in 25F (mild wind) weather and has been plenty warm.  They've been through a handful of wash cycles thus far without issue.  These seem to be a great value thus far!  One word of advise...they run a little big.  My son is 6'2" at 200lbs. and would normally wear a large.  However, we went XL based on other reviews and these tights have a perfect length and perfect fit...not too lose and not too tight.

B00PVXN4KO	Good looking, but snug, order a size or two up!	I am a woman 5'6, 188/189 lb.  I ordered the XL.  (I would normally wear a man's L size)  They are snug.  I put them on and wanted to run immediately--maybe in self defense so I would have some circulation.  LOL.  But I can tell they will be great for running.  I could have gone a size up though.  I'm keeping them because I've been losing weight...  I love the look and feel of these things.  I like the construction and the reflective areas.  I love the cushy inside.  They didn't even have the chemical smell that so many things do these days.  I just love how they make me want to run.  Will update if there is ant change of opinion after running in them.

B00PVXN4KO	Not wind proof but well made. Asian Sizing.	Seem pretty well made but Asian sizing; Medium I received would have been a Small in Pear Izumi or Craft. And not nearly as thick or water repellent a material either as either of those, but they do make good liners under wind pants or looser tights like the Craft's — They're about the same weight as a typical thermal base layer but with a draw string waist and zippered ankles, which does make them easier to get on and off. Lack of padding a plus for use on recumbent bikes. While I wouldnt dream of  riding in them solo below 55º, they do make for excellent running tights in colder weather as wind chill is not as much of an issue for that activity. Once I knew to order one size up, found them well made and comfortable enough to purchase two more for use under my tobaggon and recumbent bike trousers. Baleaf very helpful company.

B00PVXN4KO	Not Worth the Money	I'm 6'00 and bought a pair of Larges.  They ran really long making them bunch up in places.  The stitching around the waist started to unravel before even wearing them.  I thought that was tolerable considering I paid $19.99 for them.  On the third use the zipper on the pant leg became separated and no longer operable.  I went to exchange them and noticed the price of the tights had gone up to $30.  Amazon was kind enough to refund the initial cost and give me a $10 credit in order to replace the pants.  A day later after receiving the credit I notice they are $35.99.  In no way, shape, or form are these pants worth that.  Even $30 was pushing it.  If you're going to spend $36 on thermal tights there are much better options than Scamazon.	Dustin L.

B00PVXN4KO	Good Quality, Fit As Expected	These tights are a great deal for the money. Contrary to many of the reviews here, I found them to fit as they should. I'm 6'1", 190 lbs and bought a size large. They are somewhat of a compression tight, so they need to be pulled up at the knees and ankles first, then the thighs, then the hips. When put on in this way, I think you will find that they aren't too long at the ankles, nor too low at the waste as some folks have reported. I use them for cycling in temperatures below 50º (34º the lowest I've tried) and they have done a fine job of keeping my legs warm, but not overheated. I've washed them 10 times so far with no degradation in fit or wear. I've bought other items of clothing from this company since, and they have also been of good quality.

B00PVXN4KO	my husky brethren: these run a bit slim	On the plus side, these are well-constructed, quite warm, and have handy ankle zippers to assist in donning/doffing the tights.On the minus side, I'm a husky dude with tree trunk thighs and learned, while trying to squeeze my massive quads into these tights, that they were made for skinnier-legged gents.  I mean, if you carry some weight in your upper legs and enjoy the feeling of triumph after a struggle, they're awesome; but my personal rule is that the act of putting on clothing should not elicit involuntary grunts.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, these run a bit long.  Therefore, if you size up to accommodate the slim cut of these tights, you'll have quite a bit of extra length in the leg to deal with.Might I suggest as a worthy alternative to these, ASICS "Thermopolis" running tights.  Warm and snug, and sized just right for us husky guys.	Timothy M. Whalen	Size: Large	B00PVXN7SS	/gp/pdp/profile/A3LB7GELX6WWLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2016/11/21

I'm 5'11", 175 pounds and the medium size fits me perfectly.They have a nice fleece lining that does an awesome job keeping you nice and warm.  They feel like great quality thermal pants, for the money they are a steal.For cycling, I wear these as my first layer.  I put my cycling shorts over these and that works the best for me.  No chaffing and very comfortable.  My last ride was in the high 30's, it was rainy and the trail was wet.  Despite the cold and wet, I was plenty warm thanks to the thermal pants.These are nice and breathable, great for hard efforts where you work up a sweat.  Not great for wind proofing.  Personally, I prefer to have them breathable and be able to wick moisture away from me to dry out.  So, if you're looking for something wind proof/resistant you might want to move on.Overall, these are priced very well and perform great.  Keep me warm and dry while being very comfortable.	F.

B00PVXN4KO	Great product, just not the difference between these and the windproof version	If you're confused between these and the other set of baleaf's (as I was): These are fully lined and much softer than the other version.  these are more like your typical spandex pants with a soft thermal lining.  The windproof version however is a different material, more of a plastic and harder.  Would say these form fit equally as well but are more comfortable as they flex and bend a bit better, a plus when cycling.  Also, the windproof version has the knee is a very low location which makes it a bit awkard with the seams.  Highly suggest these vs the windproof version for sheer comfort and fit and haven't had an issue with the wind yet.These are perfect both in size as well as in quality.  They look like Pearl Izumi at a fraction of the price. As a average build guy 5'11, 175 with a 33 waist. The large fits perfectly and is exceptionally comfortable.  At the risk of making this post any longer I'll just say these are worth every penny and if you're looking elsewhere, you're wasting your time.  Cant go wrong for the price and quality.	randumtasx	Size: Large	B00PVXN7SS	/gp/pdp/profile/A1YEB5ILHJW0NT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	5	2016/06/27

I'm roughly 5' 7" and I fix the extra length by just folding the tights over on the calf to shorten the leg by a few inches. Otherwise a great product.

B00PVXN4KO	Feel Amazing & Do the Job!!!	Baleaf Men's Thermal Cycling Tights Size M,BlackThese pants outperform my expectations! At first I was a bit hesitant to order them. I had asked other hikers and runner about warm pants for outdoor activities in cold weather, and they referred me to products that cost about five times as much (at least) as these pants.Having worn these pants for hiking and walking outdoors in the cold Utah winter, I can honestly say: The Baleaf thermal tights are awesome!!! They work extremely well as base layer for hiking in the snow, underneath some snow pants. I also like wearing them when I go for a brisk walk around my favorite lake in the Salt Lake area (usually in the evenings when it's getting cold quickly).• They are extremely comfortable and feel very soft.• They are easy to put on (leg zippers) even though they fit tightly.• They keep me warm even in the snow.I also find that the tights help with my circulation (and probably act as some form of compression). I am totally stoked about these pants and have already purchased other products from Baleaf. I think the quality of this product (and other baleaf products) is superb, and the price is irresistibly appealing.I wold give this product 10 stars if i could!!!DISCLAIMER: I have purchased this product at full price myself. My review is honest and entirely based on my first-hand experience with the outdoor thermal tights.

Too snug through the legs -- bit odd in that the garment is, presumably, intended for wear by folks with muscular legs -- and too long for a size-small person.  In fact, these are so tight at the ankles that the zippers at those spots cannot be closed without quite a struggle (the circumference of my ankles is nothing out of the ordinary...a bit slim if anything).  Otherwise, the tights seem sturdily constructed and I'm hopeful I'll get decent wear out of them...as long as those zippers hold up to the daily tug-of-war.

There are even grippers inside of the pants where they meet your ankles in order to grip to your skin or clothing to block out the cold. I've ran in 2-30 degree Fahrenheit weather and they've kept me warm. They're also great for wearing underneath of your jeans or scrubs (for nurses).

The materials used are top notch, but I wonder why they added a zipper on the bottom of the pants, it got pretty annoying after a long distance run and rubbed against my ankles causing irritation. 3/5	MvPapa	Size: Large	B00PVXN7SS	/gp/pdp/profile/A36G5U786XAICK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2016/02/13

B00PVXN4KO	A little smaller fit but overall great pants for cycling!	I bought this pants as a gift for my husband who rides his bicycle to work everyday (even in the winter in Philadelphia!) and everything is great except that the fit is a little smaller than I expected. We're keeping them, though, because my husband is lean and they were not overwhelmingly tight, but my recommendation is to order one size larger than you think.

B00PVXN4KO	Very nice thermal tights, but runs small.	As others have said, sizing runs small. I agree with that and order up a size.The sizing dimensions look to be a size off. They do stretch a lot and may stretch out a bit after time. I ordered a size up which was a Medium and they fit pretty good. Length for the medium seems to be around 32". I am 5'6' 135 lbs (athletic build) waist 31", inseam 29" for reference.They are really nice thermal tights. Material is good but hopefully they won't pill after use. They are comfy because of of a soft fleece interior. Only time will tell but first impressions are that they are well made and stitching seems good. The design is good and has a rear pocket that surprisingly fits my Samsung Galaxy 5 inch cell phone. Zippers at ankles are good and make putting on easier.	Benjamin K.

Haven't been on the bike for a variety of reasons and needed some new togs. This must be an Asian XL, because I normally take a men's M, but from the description thought I should get these in an XL.  However putting them on was like trying to crawl into a pair of children's tights. I bet you're saying, 'well, maybe you're a lardass," but even the calves and ankles are tight. The new cycling shorts I bought (different manufacturer) XL was even a bit "loose" for lycra... Won't buy this brand again.	i_m_lilie	Size: X-Large	B00PVXNC92	/gp/pdp/profile/AAPD3WQ5O19B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	1	2016/01/14

B00PVXN4KO	Excellent cold weather running apparel	I'm 5"11" 170 lbs not overly athletic build. After reading other reviews, I decided to order Lg. By comparison I have Adidas Supernove running tights in Med and they fit perfect. The Baleaf Lg fits perfect as well, I would guess it's because they are very slightly thicker due to the thermal inside layer--this layer works amazing. I went for a morning run and the temp. was 19 F, wind chill 12 and was very comfortable in these. I would guess they might even be too warm above 30-35 F, The legs are an excellent length, I hate wearing high socks and these cover my ankles. Nice reflective touches and the leg zippers work well. Overall very pleased and would not hesitate to get more when necessary, and the price is unbeatable.

I wear these as underwear (nothing underneath) and they keep me warm when it is cold and are not uncomfortable warm when warm (indoors). So very nice. Taking a star off because there are no sizing guidelines, I bought an XL because that's my tee shirt size and having nothing else to go by that seemed like as good a guess as anything. They are neither loose or too tight so that seems to have been a correct guess, but the inseem is too long (my jeans are 28-29 inch in seem) by a little.

B00PVXN4KO	Great tights, great quality, great fit, excellent deal!	It's often hard to order clothes online, so I was a bit hesitant on these tights, but they arrived and are very quality with great seams and good fit. Similar tights that I've seen in the gear stores and even the outlets are double this price, so 20 bucks for this quality seems like a really great deal. The only thing I have an issue with is the waistband, but it's not a showstopper, just not the style of waistband that I'm used to. I'm 6'3" and 190 pounds with a 36 inch inseam and the large fits just fine. Will have to see how that works after they've been washed.

We do have some cool mornings so I was looking for something with a reasonable price.

Waste is not tight at all, And to be honest, it keeps me warm in the 20-32 degree weather-runs!

B00PVXN4KO	These are great pants for when it's cooler	These are great pants for when it's cooler. The sizes really are a little small, when I purchased compression shorts at an american retail outlet, the large was too large, so I went with a medium and even that is just a little too big. I thought I might be able to wear a medium since these run a little smaller (I ordered a medium of these tights) but it seems they fit more like a small (I am 6'1, 205 pounds). I can wear them, and I have a few times now only down to about 45 degree weather, but they kept me warm enough. They don't have windstopping fabric which protects you from the cold much better when moving quickly like in a sport like cycling, and the smaller sizes seem to stretch the fabric making it more porous allowing more air through.Overall I do like them, they compress, help my knees feel better longer I would recommend getting a size up. Good for cycling between 40-70*F and perhaps colder for slower moving sports like running.	Amazon Customer	Size: M	B00PVXN4KO	/gp/pdp/profile/AJLAX019XT04B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2015/11/05

I know these are "tights" but they are so tight they restrict movement.  I am not going to bother with the XXL.  If you are 170 lbs or under, you can probably get one that fits you, good luck!Updated 12/22/2015.  I gave in and ordered the XXL.  For the price it was worth it.  The ankles are baggy, the waist is baggy which is ok because it has a draw string to tighten it.  The thighs are tight.  It is a nice micro fleece liner which will be warm in temps below 45 degrees.  Chinese brands have screwed up sizing!  I have found this to be true with gloves and other items.

B00PVXN4KO	Great tights!	I really like these tights!  They give good support and compression to the calves and thighs.  They are very comfortable and I've worn them in temperatures as low as ten degrees, so far.  They are as warm as a pair of jeans, for example.  My two complaints are not deal breakers, just irritations.I am 6'1" with a 32" inseam and the legs are about an inch or two long for me.  The other thing is the location of the ankle zippers.  They are on the outside of the legs which is an odd position to reach to sip and unzip them.  That also places the zipper tang against the ankle bone which gets a little uncomfortable at times.  Overall though, these are great, reasonably priced, tights.	awsum140	Size: Large	B00PVXN7SS	/gp/pdp/profile/A31GPJ6LH35HEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/04/03

B00PVXN4KO	Fantastically comfortable, even for all-day wear	These are the very first sports tights I've ever purchased.  I'm buying three more of them.They just feel great, both during strenuous exercise or walking around all day.  My jeans slip right over them, adding a thermal layer that I don't want to remove even after many hours.  (Note: They are NOT hot indoors at all.)  I could get used to this, especially during this cold winter.When time comes for a workout, I just slip off the jeans, put on the right shoes and go.  Bring along your keys and/or credit cards in the zip pocket that sits at the small of your back.  The subtle stripes that show from the reinforcements even look pretty cool -- never thought I'd say that about tights on my own legs.I priced many, many brands of exercise tights and these were way down on the low end of the cost spectrum, so I wasn't expecting much.  But what a pleasant surprise.I got the XL, but I'm normally more of an L (or even an M, depending on the garment and the manufacturer) and they fit perfectly, with an extra inch or two in the leg (I'm 5' 8").  They are so super-stretchy, though, it seems they'd be fine for an actual XL sized guy.  The zippered ankles are a very nice feature and the inside of the zippers are perfectly hemmed with fabric so you never feel them.Didn't know what I was missing all these years not having something like this in my gym bag.

B00PVXN4KO	Best bang for your buck.	I purchased these mostly because of the price and the reviews.I was not disappointed at all!I am 185 pounds have a 34 inch waist with a 31 inch in seem.I purchased the large size and everything fits great, but they are a bit long.There is some extra material around the ankles and knees, however that does notdetract from them being very comfortable or from my fitness performance.  If it doesn'tlook quite right to others, well to bad, I'm not in a fashion show, and for the money, I don't care.The excess is not excessive.And yes they keep you comfortable in cold weather as well.I have run in 17 degree weather with a breeze and a wind chill of 7 degrees.I was fine.  Chilly at first, but after I warmed up, (yes it is possible in single digit weather),these tights worked wonderfully.I have run in these pants about 5 times total.  I sweat profusely, so they need washed aftereach run.  I know no one else tries to eeek out an extra run or two out of your gear, or do you?They have held up well to washing's and the low heat drying.  Sometimes they are lined dried by thewood stove, which is just as good.I couldn't be more pleased, especially with the price.	James P.

B00PVXN4KO	Forget the expensive brands- this is great!	Don't let the price fool you. These are comparable to some of the top brands out there. Keeps me warm for 2+ hour runs in 0 - 20 degree F weather. Took one star away for the ankle zippers- they take some toggling to get open sometimes. Better zippers would make this a 5 star product at an unbelievable low price. I love these!

B00PVXN4KO	Running Inside a Cup of Warm Hot Chocolate	My first run was at a temperature of 28F (-2.22C). To date, these are the warmest tights I've ever worn. It felt as if I was running inside a cup of warm, hot chocolate. They are also extremely comfortable otherwise. The waist chord is ample and provides great security once tied, and the back, center pocket is sufficient for a key or supplement. The zip ankles are also a good feature for easy entry and exit.My waist size is 34-36. I have large thighs/glutes. Based on other reviews, I ordered an XL, which is one size up from what I normally purchase. I think the fleece lining is what forces the need to size up. If you are more small-framed, you might be able to get away with order your standard size. I'm 5 foot 9; there is some puddling at the ankles but nothing that affected the wear experience.	P.

I have ridden it on a 3-4 bike ride, using a Specialized Epic and a Santa Cruz Hightower, and the gel held up so well I bought another one. Definitely something to consider when you are trying to save money on your bike gear.I would recommend these to my friends.	Don D.

So much so I had to keep pulling it up during SPIN class. Then walking a few laps to stretch the chamois was rubbing the inside of my legs. I bought these and a pair of new Pearl Izumi as I'm starting to replace older liners. The Pearls are great and were perfect right out of the box. These not at all so I will be donating to Goodwell and buying more Pearl Izumi liners.FYI - I have 3 older pair of Pearl liners that I've used for 5+ years. They are still in great shape with the waist elastic just starting to give way a bit.	G. W. Hodges	Size: Large	B01AYYL0QE	/gp/pdp/profile/ALUEOQZXG8STO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	2	2017/01/12

B01AYYKYNO	RUN, don't walk away from these shorts!	I do not generally take the time to write product reviews, but in this case I felt I really needed to. I am a new rider having had bi-lateral kneereplacements last fall. I began trail riding with my neighbor in the early summer around the first of June. We generally ride 20 to 30 miles a day,2-3 times a week, weather permitting. I ride a Jamis Explorer 2 bike with the comfort gel seat. After the first few rides, I started wearing anextra pair of thick cotton shorts under my regular shorts for some additional padding. This worked pretty well for rides of 15 miles or less.Anything longer and the padding effect quickly went away. We both searched the internet and read literally hundreds of reviews between us beforedeciding on these riding shorts. We each purchased a pair and have ridden some 60+ miles on 3 different occasions using these shorts. Can youput these on wrong? Is there some secret as to how to use these because neither of us has gotten ANY relief from butt fatigue from the use ofthese shorts! If anything, the padding bunches up in your crotch and just makes you even more uncomfortable! Combine that with the oldchafing effect and you can't wait to get off your bike! Frankly, if there were a way to give these a zero, I would! I am stuck with a $25 pair ofriding shorts that I can't return. Maybe the much more expensive brands are better, but I am not willing to take a chance on wasting even moremoney on something that just doesn't perform! I am going to buy an additional gel seat cover and go back to my old cotton shorts!	Amazon Customer	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A1CNL8NP7YMGX5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	1	2016/09/02

B01AYYKYNO	Very nice for the price, fit comparable to pearl izumi	I bought these to have a second pair of liners for mountain biking and am pleasantly surprised at the quality and comfort. I am 5'11 with about a 33 waist but larger than normal thighs, the large fit well, I could have gone medium for a snugger fit but I don't want on getting much smaller than I am now so large it was in case I put on some weight. The mesh is very breathable and comfortable, first wash and ride and everything is still intact with no fraying or rips. The pad provided comfort for the 11 mile ride I went, 0 pain or chaffing. Originally coming from the canari gel liners with the tiny tiny padding they provide, this is much better. I actually feel they compare nicely to a pair of pearl izumi liners I have. The fit is very similar and pad feel/size is similar as well. I like how they have 2 loops on both sides, a lot of baggy bike shorts have snaps/loops on the inside to hook these onto and also great for hang drying(I never put any cycling gear in the dryer) I didn't expect much from these because I never heard of the brand before but I highly recommend these. Comfortable, quality material, good craftsmanship and a nice price. Recommended	D. B	Size: Large	B01AYYL0QE	/gp/pdp/profile/A2JGWYUWLQK32X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2016/08/12

B01AYYKYNO	Good Liners	Ok, I wanted to wait long enough to have sufficient time to be sure these worked well. Now after a couple of months and several 20 mile mountain bike rides they get a thumbs up. The shorts sized out correctly which is nice for cycling shorts and provide comfort while riding. I generally don't wear riding shorts on the mountain bike so these have proved to be great liners for normal shorts. Recommend the product and the fit is comfortable. The cushion is fair and not over sized to make riding or wearing under shorts uncomfortable.	safeplay	Size: Medium	B01AYYL02S	/gp/pdp/profile/A1URZY5URIXRNX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	9	5	2016/05/23

B016UB0JDK	Great except for the super tight waistband	Edit of original review: If I could give customer service a review, it would be 10 STARS. When they read my review as seen below, they contacted me and offered to send me a size Medium so I could see if those were actually a better size for me, and if the waistband would be more comfortable. I accepted, and told them that if it was, and if I'd just sized them too small, I'd go back and upgrade my review from 3 stars. Unfortunately, the waistband is still way too tight and uncomfortable, even on the mediums. And with the mediums I now don't have the compression at the legs that I want, since really the size small fits perfectly everywhere except the waistband. I ended up just doing what others have done, and cutting into the elastic in the waistband and slicing it, so that it separates. Unfortunately the elastic is sewn on throughout (which is actually a wonderful quality aspect, since pants that don't have that end up with twisting elastic), which keeps me from being able to just pull the elastic out completely, which would be perfect. But it at least gave me an extra inch or so at the waist, changing them from super uncomfortable to tolerable. So while I can't give any more than 3 stars still, what I CAN say is that this company's customer service was by far, hands down, the BEST I've ever encountered on Amazon. Because of this, I'm going to continue to watch these tights and if they redesign them with a non-elastic, soft, wide waistband...I'll purchase immediately! :-)Original review:I wish I could give these 3.5 stars. I WANT to give them 5, because they're so awesome in SO MANY WAYS. If it just wasn't for that darned really tight waistband, they would be perfect. I'm hoping that if they see enough people complaining about it, that they'll redesign them to have a looser waist band.I'm 5'5" 123 pounds, without an athlete's build but in decent shape. I eat ridiculously healthy and work out most days. However, I do have very curvy hips, an hourglass figure no matter how in shape I am. I opted for the smalls in these because I wanted compression...no baggies. They fit perfect everywhere except the waist. When I wear these I've got a massive muffin top hanging out over the top, even though I'm not overweight. It's really really annoying, not only because it's not flattering, but it's simply VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.These seem like they were designed only for people with athletic body types, meaning pure muscle around the waist. The fabric is already made out of compression type material, so there's just no need at all to put that tight elastic around the waist. These could have simply had a wide band without the elastic, and they would still stay up perfectly. Or, also OK would be a tie at the waist without the elastic, so that people without hips don't have to worry about them falling down.Besides the waistline, these are a great; very thick, warm fabric. I run on the cold side so for temps lower than 40 or so I still need to wear sweats over them, but that's just me. Some people have complained that these don't go to the ankles, or that the ankles aren't tight enough. I have somewhat long legs for my height, and these reach my ankles. I also have really skinny ankles and these are definitely tight enough. Any tighter and my long winter running socks wouldn't be able to fit under them; but even without the long socks, they are perfectly tight enough.So the summary is, if you have a larger stomach, you'll need to size way up, which means that the legs will then be really loose...unless of course you have thick legs also. But just in general, this company seriously needs to realize that most people, even fit people, don't have 25 inch waists. It's just so old-school to have that tight, uncomfortable waist band. I still wear them and love everything else about them, thus the 3 stars...but that waistline needs to be redesigned if these are going to earn more than 3 stars.	crazybooknerd	Color: Black/Hot pink|Size: Small	B016UB00I4	/gp/pdp/profile/ADEICT6680UVT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/02/18
B016UB0JDK	Great for running in winter	These pants have been great this winter.  I've worn them to run in sub-zero temps and in the 40s.  I think 50 degrees would be too warm.  I am always cold so for these to keep me warm in the Utah winter is exactly what I needed.  After reading the reviews I ordered a medium, although I'm 5'2" in my bare feet and 110lbs and a small in any other universe.  I'm glad I got the medium as I think the small would have cut me in two at the waist.  They are a tad long, although not THAT long.  I think a tall gal would come up short.

Living in Europe with snow on the ground - I can say that these pants keep me warm and are great for walking/running. (I wear them almost every day) Like most, I too found the waist band to be tight comparatively.

These are very comfortable and warm.  I purchased these to wear under ski pants.  They are not bulky.  Initially one was purchased to see how they fit and the quality.

B016UB0JDK	Not really well designed for actual athletes.	Waistband is too thick and tight; nobody makes them like that any more. For an xcountry runner or anyone doing endurance sports it's not suitable. Also, too small. I bought an XL, still too small.

B016UB0JDK	Just ok	These are just ok. I am new to living in the midwest and was trying to find an affordable pair of workout pants and came across these. They are the warmest pants Ive tried so far, but the design of them leaves a bit to be desired. Also, I wish they came up higher on the waist because they kind of cut into my stomach (probably not a problem for people with tiny waists but I am more straight up and down). They are definitely warm though because of the fleece lining. Theyre easy to get on too, due to the zipper on the ankle (though not as stylish as they are a little flared at the bottom). I'll wear them while walking the dog and around the house but not to the gym.	9876LS9876	Color: Black/Purple|Size: Medium	B016UB0NIG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2ABPE5OPB49FZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/01/31
B016UB0JDK	Keeps you Warm!	According to measurements in the picture, I was on the border between L and XL. But after reading a few of the reviews I decided to go with the L and it fits perfectly. I love the zipper access at the ankles and the key pocket on the back. Took them this morning to ride my bike in 22*F weather and they kept me nice and warm. I would definitely recommend them. I'm not a runner, so I can't comment on their use for that, but they're not super heavy, so I think they would do nicely. I'm 5'8", 140lbs.

B016UB0JDK	Excellent quality, better than any other tights I have tried and costs much less	Very well made, firm compression-tight fabric. The inside is brushed to hold heat next to the skin. This tight beats any "brand name" tights that cost 2 or 3 times as much IMO. A cold morning for running here in Northern California is about 37 degrees and this tight is exactly what I needed for that. If you are running in 15 degrees, you may be cold at the beginning of your run, but you always are, right? A word about sizing. I am 5'4", 123 pounds, 37inch hips, 29 inch waist, muscular thighs and calves. Based on the size chart, I ordered a Medium. The Medium fit skin tight in legs and hips but was very snug in the waist. Not unwearable but tight! The elastic is firm. I will try to break the waistband in by spraying with water when I put them on. I wanted a second pair, so the next pair I bought is a Large. Comfortable in the waist, not quite as skin tight in hips and legs but not baggy either.Nothing that those of us who are not proportioned according to the rule book haven't dealt with every time we buy a garment :)	C.

B016UB0JDK	Sizing off.	First off, these are nice pants. The quality, warmth, fabric thickness, and interior softness were wonderful. However, sizing is interesting. As the weather has gotten colder, I recently pulled out my size L cold weather running gear but after having a baby last year, found them slightly too tight. Not unwearable, just slightly uncomfortable. Confident in my ability to shed some baby weight, I decided to get a few less expensive items in size XL to temporarily replace my cold weather running Under Armour tights. THESE PANTS ARE TIGHTER ON MY WAIST than my all size L compression UA, Nike, and Reebok leggings. I wish I could keep these, so soft and warm, but unfortunately they have to go back.

B016UB0JDK	Good quality but some design flaws	I like that these leggings/pants are thicker than my Joe Fresh Warm Active Leggings.  However, the waist band can sit uncomfortably during normal wear.  I also dislike the ankle area. There's no point in really having a zipper there if the bottom isn't tapered enough.  The problem isn't the zipper, its the non-tapered-ness.  These are legging pants no?  Who wears a size small and have massive ankles?  Very unflattering.  It's also rather large in the thigh area and doesn't offer enough compression-not great for improving the look of your booty!However, 3 stars for quality fabric.  If you're intending on using these for outdoor sports and don't care about wearing them doing other things or for fashion reason, then these are great pants for a great value!EDIT: Excellent customer service reached out to me after this review regarding some of my concerns!	coneyisland	Color: Black|Size: Small	B016UB04QC	/gp/pdp/profile/AF3L1S11PBR78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/01/13

They are softer and thicker than I expected, and they do a good job keeping me warm while trail running in the winter.  In fact, I like these so much I ended up buying three more pairs so that there is always a pair clean for me to wear.I am careful when I wash these, and I use the gentle cycle.  I pull them out and let them dry on a rack rather than putting them in the dryer.  I do this for all my technical fabrics, so it is not trouble.  I've found that athletic wear lasts much longer when not subjected to heat in the dryer.I like the black tights so much that I often wear them with longer tops around the house and running errands on the weekends.  I am 5'3 and 125 pounds and the small fits me well.  I am even able to put a thin pair of long underwear under them for really cold days.I did have an incident where one of the pairs arrived with defective stitching.  I sent it back and ordered the same thing again.  I have not had any issues with the pairs I currently own.  Just be sure to check the tights over for defective stitching when you get them.

The fleece lining is super warm on cold days when I go running, and the outside fabric and details are really smooth and nice. I love that these leggings have an elastic waistband, which helps it not slide down when I'm doing stuff. The zippers near the ankles are a nice touch, though the leg openings are just a tad loose for my taste, and it's a little short (but that's probably because I'm taller than average). Also, the pocket (despite its good quality) is like an inch deep! I could fit maybe a key or two in there but that's it.

B016UB0JDK	Very comfortable, not that warm	These are comfortable pants. Love the wide waist band - lays flat while moving, so pants stay in place -  no pulling them up while you run. While they are warmer than my regular running tights - they aren't all that warm and fleecy. I'd call them mid weight not really what I wanted for long periods outdoors in the winter.

B016UB0JDK	Great cold weather running tight	I really love these running tights. I run all winter long and these keep my legs toasty warm in freezing temperatures. They fit true to size, I'm tall and wear size 12 or 14 pant and  usually wear a large or xl tights and the large fit me well, They don't ride down when running and have a nice compression feel without being constrictive. The pocket fits my iphone 6 but it's a really tight, wish the pocket and opening were a little bigger, hence the 4 stars. Many women need to run with phones for fitness tracking and personal safety, I think running clothes should be designed for our needs.

I wore them today (December 10) in St. Louis for the Hot Chocolate 15K. It was about 36 degrees with quite a windchill, and my legs were toasty without being overly warm. Plus they look great! I kind of wish they had draw strings, but I had zero problems with them falling down. And the back pocket is nice and roomy!

B016UB0JDK	Cute, tight waist, lose ankle.	Fleece-lined running pants that look cute. I am 115 and bought size small. Wish I had gotten XS to try on, BUT like other reviewers said, the waist is uncomfortable. The waist is about a 1.5" band--not the wider "panels" that most running pants have. They are lose in the ankles and a little short on length--it will leave a gap between my socks and pants, which won't be great for the cold.Bought for a 1/2 marathon in 30-35 degree weather.

The fleece inside felt good though like it really would have kept me warm.Shipping was very slow/poor. Ordered on Nov 25, should have been delivered Dec 05 but got an email instead in that day to say it wouldn't be delivered until Dec 15. Sad it didn't work out after all that wait and drama.

B016UB0JDK	Great Tights!	I bought these for hiking in Maine during Thanksgiving week.  They worked very well at temperatures in the low 30s.  It was very wet (mix of rain and snow) and they felt warm and repelled water well. I would highly recommend them for this situation.  I do think that the ankle zippers might be an issue if you wanted to tuck them into high hiking boots though.

B016UB0JDK	Soft Inside	These are very comfortable and I love the soft lining. I'm not disappointed with my purchase, but there are a couple of issues I've found that keep me from giving these a five-star rating. First, the waistband is a little tighter than I normally like. I ordered medium, which is what I usually wear (size 6-8). Secondly, the ankles want to rise up on my calf. I have skinny calves, so this may not be a problem for everyone. I'm 5'4" and I like the length ... until they creep up my calves. In all, I like them a lot. I just don't love them.

B016UB0JDK	So warm and comfortable!	I LOVE these leggings! I was looking for warm layers for a recent trip to Iceland, and these fit so well and are very comfortable and warm! I would wear a thin thermal layer underneath these, with a thin waterproof layer on top, and I managed to stay warm even when spending some time outside in the Iceland cold! They are so comfortable that I even wear them now around the house or for errands. I'm usually a size small in yoga pants so I purchased these in Small as well - I would say they are true to size. The only bad thing I would have to say is that if you are petite (I am 5'2") they run long, but I actually prefer pants that run long in cold weather so that they can cover my ankles.

B016UB0JDK	The cycling pants were warm and looked great on	The pants were somewhat tight on me.  I have larger than normal calves and ankles, but I was able to get them on just fine, it's just that the zipper runs along side of the ankle, which is great for getting them on and off, but the zipper dug into my ankles.  My recent ride was only 3 hours so it was ok, I put up with the discomfort. But I will continue to wear them because they did keep me warm, they fit well and they looked good on me.  I will probably change the socks that I wear in the future.	Robyn	Color: Black/Hot pink|Size: Large	B016UB09E4	/gp/pdp/profile/A2HLFAGFS0QI3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/03/28

B016UB0JDK	Toasty!	I have been on a dozen runs in these and I am very happy. Yesterday in 41 F temps I was too warm and had to take off my jacket after 10m. The coldest run I did in these was 22 F coupled with a long sleeve top, insulated sweat shirt, gloves, wide head band, and wool socks. I was fine until cool down. During cool down my legs were warm while my feet and chest were cold. So these do keep you arm in low temps! 12 washes and they look new still and are holding up well. Often during my post run yoga practice I have issues with my running pants rolling down at the waist. No similar issue with these pants, they stay put!	Justine R.

B016UB0JDK	Solid quality and performance: 4.5 stars	- Performance: 5 stars. Great for outdoor sports - they're warm without any bulk at all. Looking at them when worn, they appear to be regular running tights. The inside is soft and cozy, yet wicks sweat very efficiently. I did 7 miles in them at 45 degrees F and was toasty warm and dry throughout.- Quality: 4.5 stars. They wash up nicely, with only a few (cosmetic) loose threads around the ankle zippers. Overall construction is solid.- Features: 5 stars. Reflective details are small but visible. Ankle zippers are a nice touch for getting the pants on/off. The zipper pocket sits in the small of your back and will fit an iPhone5, but an iPhone 6 would be a squeeze. (Tip: If you're going to break a sweat, put your phone in a ziplock bag before shoving it in your pocket. Not just with these pants - with anything that's next to your body. Sweat kills an awful lot of mobile devices.)Fit: 3.5 stars. This is personal preference based on my body type, so your experience will be different. However this may help you decide if these will work for you. I'm 5'4" and 135 pounds with a very athletic build. My waist is 29.5" and the waist of the pants, unstretched, is 26.5", so the waist is tight enough to be a little uncomfortable. I have long legs and a short torso, so the legs of the pants are a perfect fit, but the rise  to the waistband lands well above my navel (unlike the manufacturer's photo, which shows the pants about 2" below). For those of you with more feminine hips and waists, this will likely not be a problem for you. If you're more square or apple-shaped, be prepared for a squeeze at the waist.	J. D.

B016UB0JDK	Love the feel and fit hate the zippers	Love the feel and fit. They dont crawl around on you. However, note the zippers can hurt if you are wearing these with taller shoes (I wore with rain/snow boots to NFL game) also the zippers became difficult to use after first couple of washes. Think I'll look for a similar pair without the zippers. Also, my thighs did get cold during the game. Only part of my legas that had only the leggings. If using for extended period, consider using as a layer and not alone.	Amanda	Color: Black|Size: Large	B016UB0FMA	/gp/pdp/profile/A2AMPFY62QYGSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	3	2016/01/10

B016UB0JDK	Great price for a great product	Well, technically it's my daughter who loves the tights.  She runs winter track and has been playing lacrosse outside.  Early morning games are pretty cold, and these thermals help keep her legs warm.  She owns Nike and Underarmour, but for cold mornings these are her first choice.  She loves the soft lining.  When her friends' parents found out how much I paid - and when they saw the soft lining - I saw a few pick up their phones and log into Amazon ;)  Will have to get her another pair or two, because she keeps making us wash the tights every night so she can have them the next day.  We'll see how they hold up to repeated washing, but so far they still look great.	MP	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B016UB09OO	/gp/pdp/profile/A22P6D03908QCL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	12	5	2015/11/30

B01GRHQFRG	runs big	I'm 5'4 140-142lbs.  I went with the reviews and sized up to a medium. Fits pretty long and clings to my body which isn't appealing when you have a bit of bulge. I guess I'm content with the size I chose, large would have been way too big and small would have fit perfectly but perhaps too snug and this tank will be use for the gym so i want something lose fitting.

I absolutely LOVE this shirt, arrived quickly, the fit is perfect, the fabric is incredibly comfortable, wicks away moisture and dries quickly, flattering cut that is also incredibly functional and very well made. I own many workout tops, I work out 5-6 days a week, this top is already one of my favorites, I have also just worn it out socially because it's so very comfortable and have received many compliments on it.  I am 5'5", about 125 LB, ordered size small, fit is comfortably snug but not too tight. I have already ordered a second one in another color.

I got the large jacket and it fit perfectly. by perfectly, I mean there was not too much excess room, just enough to feel unrestricted movement.the jacket can serve as a midlayer during the cold season (wear it over you zip mock and over your jacket and you have a perfect recipe for warmth). you can also use it as an outerlayer during the cold, too. it blocks the wind and keeps the water out very well for its relatively light weight.the side pockets are well placed and usable. the collar zips up well and really locks in the warmth.and the color is beyond neon...it's spectacular.for the price, this is quite a good investment.

B01LC21KQM	Perfect fit, great color, covers everything you need in a basic cycling/running jacket	Rarely do I try something on for the first time and it fits so perfectly. I am 5'8", 175 lbs and the Large fits me like a glove. This is a very light windbreaker type jacket, not for really cold weather, though you could easily layer something underneath- but I got it mainly for safety. The color is great, and it's not see through so even if you wear a dark shirt underneath, it doesn't show through or mute the color. The 3 zipped pockets are excellent, but as others have mentioned, the front zipper is on the wrong side (why do so many cycling jackets do this?) and is a little finicky. There is a vent in the top of the back that should help with ventilation, which is nice because the material of the jacket isn't very breathable. And of course there is the reflective logo on the back, as well as reflective elements on the front, so it's good for running or cycling at night. It seems Baleaf really covered everything they needed to in a basic cycling jacket- I am very pleased with it.

B01LC21KQM	Fits in my bike saddle bag	The thin material allows me to roll up the jacket to the size of a soda can and stuff it into my saddle bag.  That way I don't get baked after the sunlight appears on my long morning rides.I like the understated styling that doesn't attract stares if we stop by a coffee shop on our rides.The mesh ventilation system in the back works somewhat, if I partially unzip the front to let a bit of wind blows through.  But my arms are still wet from my own sweat.When temperature drops below 60F, this is not warm enough.  I put on a thicker jacket.

B01LC21KQM	Nice jacket.	I like this jacket. I used to have the plastic kind but it ripped. This fabric works well. I ran the arm under my faucet to test. The water glided off the surface and seam. Im 5 foot 10 inches and 170 pounds. I got the Large size which is slightly loose so I can wear two jerseys under for winter. The neck is snug. Hopefully that would keep some rain out. I wear a 15.5 inch dress shirt.	Adam Martin	Color: Fluorescent Yellow|Size: Large	B01LC21IEQ	/gp/pdp/profile/ATU0WRRS42M1F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	4	2016/11/02
B01LC21KQM	Not a bad problem to have and I don't think I'll try ...	I just got it and I haven't had a lot of time to wear it but I wanted to point out one issue with the fit. I'm 5'9'' ~155lb and I think my chest is roughly 38'' and it fits well in the chest and shoulders and waist, but it is tight in the bicep area when bending arms. Not a bad problem to have and I don't think I'll try to return it since it fits well everywhere else but I can only bend the arms maybe 3/4 without them binding. I'll have to ride once it gets cold to see if this is an issue. I don't have massive biceps (maybe a little over average for my size) but if you are bulky keep that in mind and you may have to order a size up to avoid that or if all you are worried about is riding and won't be bending your arms a lot it should be OK.	lrice	Color: Black|Size: Small	B01LC217KG	/gp/pdp/profile/A3B8PUW18Z3PV5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	4	2016/10/27

B01LC21KQM	Overall a nice jacket. The sleeves are slender and can bind ...	I followed the advice of others in the reviews here and got the right size.  Overall a nice jacket.  The sleeves are slender and can bind a bit when bent 90 degrees - but not really much of an issue when actually riding.  However, if I were in the same shape I was 20 years ago I would probably have to get a larger size in order to be comfortable.  The fabric is very light and I'm still experimenting with what to wear under it at various temperatures.  The bright color does give me some comfort when riding on the increasing number of grey days as winter approaches.

B01FLUQITU	Fits tight and short	I'm normally a small in t-shirt size, but I went up to a medium because I think baleaf's products tend to run small (i.e. capris, pants, and these racerbacks). You need to be pretty slim to wear this (without any bulge hanging out) as these fit pretty tight (would not recommend if you have any bulge/self conscious) and short. It would be better if they were a tad bit longer, my own personal preference.	LC	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B01FLUQGNI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2ONQG82MFQ4ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/06/15

B01FLUQITU	great workout top. Love the length. Love the fabric. Doesn't show sweat	Great shirt. Has the type of Athletic fabric that doesn't show your sweat like how it cotton fabric shirt would. It is long enough to not fall up when you lean over or do specific workouts. I am 5 foot 3 3/4. I weigh 153 pounds and my waist is 31 inches. I bought a medium and it fits me perfectly with just enough looseness that it is not too tight. It is very comfortable to move around in. I had my sweatshirt tied around my waist the whole workout, so I can't say for sure if it rides up since I have a small mom stomach. However, when I was wearing it earlier in the day with my jacket on top of it and nothing around my waist, it did ride up when I was walking around.

B01FLUQITU	Great tank for cardio and strength training	I do really like this shirt. I would say it runs on the generous side of the sizing. Based on the product descriptions the Medium size bust is 35-37" and the waist is 27.5-29.5". I usually use 36" for my bust and 28" for my waist measurements. The shirt fits well in the bust but feels a little to roomy in the stomach area so it doesn't stay close to my body in yoga, and so I end up showing more skin than I'd like during inversions in yoga and I have to keep adjusting it. I love the color of the mint, it is true to the picture and the material is of very good quality. I will use this tank for running, strength training, and spin, but I will not be using this tank as a yoga top. I would maybe try this shirt in a smaller size if I buy it again. The quality is good for the price.	PlumplingDumpling	Color: Mint Green|Size: Medium	B01FLUR19G	/gp/pdp/profile/ADFAOUZ41WWLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	4	2016/11/29

B01FLUQITU	Great fabric and material just know what size to order!	I read most of the reviews before placing this order and I decided on Medium just to be safe. I wear Small tops all the time and I wanted something snug but not tight. So the Medium is nice but big. I can still wear it but it's loose on me even the top part. I love the feel of the fabric, very soft, just stretchy enough, good comfortable design and the Mint color was lovely. I am going to give it 4 stars because of the size complication and the 74% true to fit statistic. It's confusing. I know now that I need to order Small next time which I will. Definitely LOVE this tank top though.	Farnoosh Brock	Color: Navy Blue|Size: Small	B01FLUQXK4	/gp/pdp/profile/A2PATWWZAXHQYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	4	2016/11/05

B00PVUR34K	generally good, especially for mid-fall or later spring riding, or for layering with a balaclava	Overall, I rate the Baleaf Thermal Skill Cap as generally good, especially for mid-fall or later spring riding, or for layering with a balaclava.Fit: is a little large (don't have a large head), so while it fits my head it is looser than another of my skull caps; fits very well under my bike helmet, and does not get too close to my eyes.Warmth: is thinner than other products, so it layers well over a balaclava, but does not stop wind, and would not be enough by itself on colder days.Fabric: it stretches, but it is not lycra/spandex -- more of a cotton feel; appears to be well constructed, and should provide some years of use.

B00PVUR34K	Great Cool Weather Skull Cap	I purchased this skull cap for cold weather bike rides. This skull cap is very comfortable and fits perfectly. The cap is made of stretchy material to accommodate different head sizes. The fleece lining adds warmth, comfort, and extra padding. This cap does a great job of keeping out cold wind on my rides. My helmet fit perfectly over the cap after I made some minor helmet adjustments. This skull cap comes highly recommended.The drawback to this skull cap is that the area of the cap covering the ears could be a bit longer. Without wearing a helmet, the length around the ears comes to the very bottom of my ear. When I strap on the helmet, the cap area around the ears pull through the helmet straps, leaving the bottom of my ears somewhat unprotected. I would not use this skull cap for temperatures under 35 degrees F because of the lack of length around the ears.

B00PVUR34K	Seems warm, but small.	Tried to give it a good try, but turns out it's too small to feel comfortable when wearing, i.e., doesn't really cover the ears and feels small.  Weird, as I usually have to search to buy hats small enough to fit my head.  Still hoping it will stretch out, but might end up as a gift to someone younger with smaller head.	K.

B00PVUR34K	Keeps the wind off the noggin	This is a must for winter riding. It keeps the wind out yet allows your head to breathe a little. My only gripe is that the ear flaps could be a little longer, but honestly they cover enough of the ear to be effective. I would like the ear material to be a little thicker, but for the price it's pretty good. I question whether I should have just bought ear warmers because the material really isn't thick enough to be noticeably warmer, but if it was too thick I wouldn't be able to get my helmet on. So, it's just enough to keep the wind chill down and that's about it.	ROBIN	Color: Black-	B00PVUR34K	/gp/pdp/profile/A1VTRROX5ZC54A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2016/03/08

B00PVUR34K	If You Have A Large Head With Detached Earlobes, Look Elsewhere	I have a larger than average head and from the reviews some people said that it will fit just fine (even with heads larger than mine), but I've had a different experience. While it does fit tightly around my head, it doesn't cover the bottoms of my ears entirely which was one of the major points of buying this. I have detached earlobes, the kind that isn't attracted to your face a.k.a. you should be able to flick your earlobe and it wobble ha ha. Because of this I have to pull and pull to stretch the material to get it to come over my earlobes only for it to pull up and curl my earlobes with it, which is really annoying.While it does keep me slightly warm and blocking the wind, it is NOT breathable which it needs to be to keep the sweat off your head so you don't freeze when you take it off.

Makes my head look a little funny, but with the helmet on and the ride beginning I forget all about it, which is great because that means I'm also not thinking how cold it is on my ears and head.  I bought this for cold morning rides (40F-60F) and it more than does the trick in heating up even wiht my very short ride of 4 miles each way.It's comfortable and fits all right, but I've got slightly bigger head and ears than I thought and the Large size doesn't quite cover the lobes. I get a little bit of wind noise due to the space left there.There is a nice loop for pony tails for longer-haired riders. It is all in all fairly well built (the stitching doesn't dig into my skin at all, or at least as much as underwear elastic would).

B00PVUR34K	Almost, but not quite!	I ordered and just received this, since I had read reviews that said it would fit an extra large head, (mine has a 7 3/4" hat size) and if yours is about this size or larger, DON'T ORDER THIS!!! My "Pearl Izumi Men's Barrier Skull Cap, Black, One" actually fits better than this does, (albeit this one is thermal, and the "Pearl Izumi" one is'nt) and that's only because I have a VERY short haircut! The only reason I think the 'Pearl Izumi' one fits better, is because I can move my head around (like you would do normally) without it working its way loose and coming off my ears (which I bought it for in the first place). Wish this fit, I would love to try it!	Thomas W.	Color: Black-	B00PVUR34K	/gp/pdp/profile/A2OSZF63XBU5VJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	10	2	2015/10/29

I guess, my point here is, if it's warm enough to not wear my ushanka, I'm not wearing this either.  If it's chili enough to wear this, I'd rather wear my ushanka.	J.

B00PVUR34K	Great Thermal Cap for a Good Price.	I ws looking for an under-helmet thermal cap with a wind-resistant front panel, and over-ear protection. This fit the bill. Made from a tightly knit thermal microfiber, I washed this the first evening I received it and it was completely dry by the next morning. Wicking is an important feature for me as I perspire from my head when exercising. The cap is thin enough to fit comfortably under my helmet and provide a smooth and comfortable cushion layer without any pressure points. I wear a large hat size and this cap fits my head perfectly and does not feel overstretched or excessively tight. There is a thicker inner liner that wraps around the front panel back to the ears to block the wind. The rest of the cap is made of a single layer of thermal microfiber. The only shortcoming I found with this cap was that the first language on the labeling was Chinese, and there were no washing or fabric care instructions included. This should not be a problem if you handle this cap like the rest of your microfiber active wear. Tomorrow will be a chilly day, highs in mid 50's and overcast, so I'll be giving this cap it's first field test. Unless I post an update, you can assume that it performed well.

I usually use them when riding to work 2 miles in 50-60°F weather, and then run for 2 miles before going into work.

B014GVQDK4	I think these might be great if you have a 32" or longer inseam	The legs were long for me, I have a 30" inseam. They are so tight that you can't bunch them up. (I'm 5'9" 160 lbs) If you only half zip the calf zipper, it chafes. I think these might be great if you have a 32" or longer inseam, but they are just a little too long for me. They are VERY warm. They are my go to sub 30 degree running pants. I'd really like these if they were available in different inseams.

They are decidedly not water proof (in case anyone was wondering) but they do an excellent job with blocking the wind and keeping him warm when he's biking or running.  These ones are truly thinner and better suited for running in any sort of really cold weather, but are suitable for biking in less chilly weather.

B014GVQDK4	Great option for XC (Cross County) Skiing	I got these for XC skiing; needed something windproof on the front, stretchy and tight-like, and would fit over the top of cross country ski boots.  These fit the bill just fine, and, while not as nice as high end XC ski pants, those come in well over $100.  For going over the boots, just leave the bottoms zipped and stretch them over; tried unzipping and then zipping over the  boots but that was pretty stressful on the zippers.For fit:  Since it's XC skiing, I'm not bending over like cyclists so the (relatively) lower back side wasn't an issue at all.  I'm a 31 waist and got a large, which was somewhat loose(ish) but allowed me to put another layer of thin tights beneath it and still have decent mobility.  If this was my only layer and I wanted a complete sleek-stretched fit, a M would have been the right call.

For running and XC skiing, I've been comfortable down to 5F without a base layer. For cycling, these are good down to about 30F without a base layer.Based on my experience with U.S. brands, I initially ordered a medium. They were fine at the waist, but a real struggle to get into.

B014GVQDK4	A great pair of tights and the size chart is pretty accurate.	I purchased these to use while riding my bicycle. I have been riding in 40-45 degree wet weather with only rain pants over them, and they have done well. I bought the XXXl size as I am 6'/280 lbs and they are a little big and too long.

B014GVQDK4	Too small and tight for me. Sent them back.	I ordered these after looking at a lot of similar products and reading every review. I also went to the Baleaf site and studied their sizing chart before ordering.  Background. I am a 67 year old man who likes to cycle. I'm 5'7" and weigh about 165.  I have weight around the middle, 34" waist, but my legs are lean and mean.  So, based on what I read, I ordered a medium.  Big mistake. They were way too small in the legs, mainly lower legs, and a little small from the crotch up.  I suppose I should have ordered a large.  I know I couldn't go larger than that.  Still, the legs were so tight, I can't imagine biking in them. Especially since there are seams behind the knees that are very disturbing. I will order something else, but I'm thinking I should buy something with a looser fit.  These appear to be more suited for someone who has a thin build with no extra weight anywhere.  Like the guy in the picture. LOL.	Russ Martin	Size: Medium	B014GVQDK4	/gp/pdp/profile/AHB0VJNJWMG8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	2	2016/12/13

B014GVQDK4	Good for active cool weather cycling, with a few caveats	I have several Baleaf Cycling tights, this windproof version has issues, but is still my 'go to' winter tight. first of all the sizing is very messed up, My regular Baleaf Thermal Tights are Large (6' 1" 210) and fit perfectly, when I bought these in Large, they would not pass over my calves (which are slightly above average but not crazy) when I went to the the XL which I am using now, the waist is pretty sloppy and I need to tie them pretty tight to stop them coming down. The are not a warm as the regular Thermal ones when standing around, but these respond much better to cycling specific activities. i.e. windstopping, breathing, when cycling moderately aggressively and above these work much better.

I could hardly get these pulled up over my calves they were so tight. I'm a relatively skinny guy - 5'10, 150lbs, not very muscular and I was very surprised at how tight they were throughout the legs. I had purchased these for running. The fit in the waist was just fine.

These are just a little short (but when you're as tall as me what isn't short?) but nothing that a slighter longer pair of socks can't correct or longer shoe covers, which is what worked for me. They are comfortable and they are not stiff like some windproof clothing.

B014GVQDK4	Great Value	I followed the measurement chart and was rewarded with a perfect fit. I think the most important measurement are the hips and waist. The calf measurement was unrealistic, and if I had followed it, I would have had the extra large pants. My apparently 14" massive calves fit fine in the medium tights. The pants kept me quite warm on a cool 48 degree ride.

B014GVQDK4	Warm and Size Chart Is Very Accurate	These are comfortable and warm, and they fit well. When sizing, use the chart as intended: get a seamstress tape measure out (or a string) and measure your waist, hips and calf directly on the skin. The sizing chart is accurate if you do this.  But if you are in the US, be prepared for this: you may wear pants that are labeled as 34 inches in the waist, but your actual measurement will be at least 1 inch larger.  And don't base your size choice on any review that says something like "I'm 5'8" and 180 lbs and had to get the XXL."  Height and weight do not completely define body type.

B014GVQDK4	Great pants at a good price - just note the difference between these and the thermal running	If you're confused between these and the other set of baleaf's (as I was): These are fully lined and a bit harder plastic material than the running versions, though both could be used for cycling.  Would say these form fit equally as well but are slightly less comfortable comfortable as the windproofing makes it a litle firmer material than the soft spandex. Also, this windproof version has the knee is a very low location which makes it a bit awkard with the seams.  Would suggest the others vs windproof but either are good choices depending on preferenceThese are perfect both in size as well as in quality.  They look like Pearl Izumi at a fraction of the price. As a average build guy 5'11, 175 with a 33 waist. The large fits perfectly and is exceptionally comfortable.  At the risk of making this post any longer I'll just say these are worth every penny and if you're looking elsewhere, you're wasting your time.  Cant go wrong for the price and quality.	randumtasx	Size: Large	B014GVQHI2	/gp/pdp/profile/A1YEB5ILHJW0NT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/06/27

B014GVQDK4	Resemble more expensive running tights, but obviously a knock off.	The fabric is of lower quality than the most affordable New Balance or ASICS. The cut of waist and upper leg is comically out of proportion.  I bought small and medium to compare, and both have the same problem.The pocket on both is at an aggravating and uncomfortable position.Also a huge drawback to these tights:  the crotch is vented with a different material than the rest of the tights.

B014GVQDK4	Nice quality, just not comfortable	I ordered a pair of these to stay warm and dry in wetter weather. It does the trick but the panels are stitched in a way that make them somewhat uncomfortable. I found them to bunch up a little more than I'd like. I think this is due to the windproofing of the fabric which limits the stretch-ability of the fabric. Either way, I didn't find them to be any warmer than my Nashbar brand tights which are remarkably comfortable. Sending back and sticking with my other ones. I have other Baleaf products that I love, but this one just misses the mark and my expectations.

B014GVQDK4	Responsive, helpful customer support; Good value product	FINAL UPDATE: GOOD VALUE RUNNING PANTS, WAISTLINE AT SMALL OF BACK SITS A BIT LOW, GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT.Original review:Bought a large, based on what others my size bought. I'm 5'10"/175. They are way too small and too tight. They are difficult to put on because they are so tight. The crotch on them is so low that you must work the entire length of each pant leg higher, if you want to get them all the way on. This results in the bottom of the pant leg being well above the ankle, which then makes it difficult to zip the bottom over the calf. Once you cinch the pant above the knee and work the excess over the thigh and finally high enough that the crotch of the pants is at your actual crotch, you'll find that the waist is still too low. In particular, the back is exceptionally low. Imagine pants with a waist that sit an inch or more lower than your underwear waistband. Very awkward. You'll constantly want to pull the pants up, but there is absolutely no extra material available. Additionally, all that work to get the pants high enough to feel somewhat normal, is then defeated by gravity. After walking a few steps, gravity combined with the stretch of the pants will pull the crotch back down again, restricting leg movement, and looking like some kind of Justin Beiber fashion statement. I'm returning these, then probably ordering an XL once I get the refund. I'll upgrade my review if the new size is better.Edit: A few days after posting my review, the company emailed me that they had modified the waistband issue and would ship me a larger size for free. They also asked if their solution was satisfactory, which of course it is. 5+-stars for their customer service. I'll further edit and re-star this review upon trying out the XL size they are sending.Edit 2: The new XL size I now have are a much better fit. The low waistline in the back is still there, but not as large and not as awkward. These will work well for running	Trout52	Size: Large	B014GVQHI2	/gp/pdp/profile/A18A70VNNLM8LY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	4	2016/01/01
B014GVQDK4	UPDATED review	You can read my original review (2-stars) below, but I hope this update is helpful.  After leaving that review, the company contacted me to thank me for the feedback.  They said they'd corrected the problem in the cut of the tights and wanted to send me a free pair to evaluate.  The pair they sent had a much better cut across the back of the waistline.  I was able to bend over and stretch without getting "plumber's crack".  As I mentioned in my original review, I use these primarily for running, but I think the updated version would even be comfortable to cycle in (even hunched over).  These will become a staple in my winter running gear.  Thanks to a manufacturer who is truly invested in perfecting their products and keeping their customers happy!ORIGINAL:  The look and construction were actually top notch - I really wanted to like these, but the waist was just too low in the back.  I constantly felt like my pants were falling down and people were going to see my rear.  I got these for running, and I couldn't even stand the low height for that (and don't even think about cycling in them).  These were obviously high quality - loved the windproof fabric and the feel of the fit otherwise, but the cut of the waist was just too low.  Was sorry I had to return these.

B014GVQDK4	just to see which one fits better. Size L were a little too snug	I'm 6.2, 200lbs, about 33.5 inseam. I normally wear 33-34 size pants, depending on the brand. Amazon's size chart put me at size M (based on waist size), but after reading other reviews here, I realized that I probably needed to go with at least L or maybe even XL. So I ordered both L and XL, just to see which one fits better. Size L were a little too snug, both in the legs and hips, so much so that I had hard time putting them on (and I don't have huge legs). They were also a little on a short side for me. XL fit a little better, except were obviously too big in the waist (since they are sized for 38"-42" waist), but I figured I could cinch them up tight enough with the drawstring, so I decided to keep XL. Now, if you're buying these for running - they are probably fine. However, I bought them for mountain biking on colder days, and I'll second what another reviewer has said - these are cut way too low for cycling. Since they don't have the gel inserts, I had to wear Baleaf 3D padded cycling underwear underneath these pants, and within minutes, my backside and my underwear were for all to see. So I'm knocking off a couple of stars for that, since these are marketed as cycling pants.As to the quality, the fabric feels nice, they are fairly comfortable, and they kept me warm at the beginning of the ride (around 50 degrees) and were still comfortable after 3.5 hour ride (around 65 degrees). But some of the threads on the back have already started unraveling after very first use (before I even washed them), so I don't expect them to last very long.I've purchased several different Baleaf clothing in the past year and find their products to be good quality at decent prices. In this case, however, I can't give these pants more than 2 stars, unfortunately.	Alex	Size: X-Large	B014GVQ804	/gp/pdp/profile/AQHLPNU0UNVMT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	25	2	2015/11/16

I usually wear medium and these guys definitely fit tight, but I think that's the style from the pictures. Great cut and perfect for long runs. I am also a cyclist so the way bottoms are crafted need to be really well done, I cannot have a cheap single seam pulling my bottoms down while I ride... these are perfect. No complaints.

B01AUQI802	Just okay for running	I bought these because I wanted compression shorts with a key pocket.  Most reviews say they fit good but for me I found them to be a little tight and to fit differently than any other compression shorts from other makers.  I'm used to wearing UA and Adidas compression shorts so it's probably just me on the fit.  I wear them to run and I think they're just ok for running.  The material is also heavier than what I'm used to so they're not see through.  I also bought a pair of the 7" Baleaf compression shorts and found them to fit better than these in the same size.	bdj939	Color: Black Grey|Size: Large	B01AUQI938	/gp/pdp/profile/A1Y3WZGIIQ6OOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/06/10

I got a small in the other Baleaf item (capri length with a media pocket on each thigh) and these are smaller than the small in that item.  That is the only reason I deducted a star.  Sizes should be consistent across different products by the same manufacturer, in my opinion.	S.

B01AUQI802	A good exercise short, but a little low-waisted for me.	I really like these shorts. I ordered a large and they fit well. They are not very high rise, and that was a little disappointing, as I feel like I need to keep pulling them up, but it's just because they are short-waisted. I'm 5'1" and 130lbs and have a 33 inch waist and a 38 inch hip. I absolutely would not recommend anyone bigger than that buying anything smaller than that, they are quite tight. I wouldn't want to do any aerobic exercise in these, they just don't feel like they would cover my belly if I moved too much. To me, if they are going to market them as compression shorts, they should make the rise tall enough to compress the belly, as these would just make an awful muffin-top in any smaller size. As they are, in a size that is bigger than the measurements suggest, they make cute casual exercise shorts I wouldn't wear for any active activity unless I had a perfectly flat and flawless belly (which I do not have). If you're already super hot and thin and have that perfect belly, these will look amazing on you. If you're a normal person like me with some stretch marks and belly fat, you'll be disappointed in the low coverage these offer.

B01AUQI802	Good For Hot Yoga!	I bought these shorts because typical yoga shorts are so tiny that they roll up and look like panty-impostures.Pros:1. Minimal rolling up.2. opaque, so I can really get into stretches without fear.3. I threw it in the dryer - it's still holding up.Cons:1. The print makes me look wide in the hips.It is plain unflattering for a curvy lady. I am not large, but I was shocked when I looked at myself in the mirror at yoga class!!All in all, these are a keeper. I wouldn't go out of way to buy another pair because of the print design. But, I am comfortable enough to wear these to hot yoga class, where everyone is sweating and suffering just like me.

I bought the usual size I buy in compression shorts -- a large because big butt -- and I wish I would've gone with the XL. They were a bit tight around the thighs. (These are probably true to size for tiny people with no butts.)Other than that, they don't ride up, are long and comfortable, and the colors are true to the picture. My only other complaint is on the design -- the color location on the sides really creates an appearance of wider hips. So if you're concerned about something like that, you might look for something else.I'll definitely be buying these again in XL and seeing how those work.

B01AUQI802	Great workout/running short	Have worn these in size M half a dozen times or so now, they wash and dry well, and are great for running. My body type is such that my legs and thighs are super thin in proportion to my waist so I have a hard time finding clothes that fit right. Leg openings are still a tiny bit big on these but a small wouldn't fit my waist. They don't ride up when running.

B01AUQI802	Great shorts: measurements included for reference (small)	This shorts fit well. I am 5'4", 117 lbs, 25" waist, 22" thigh, 37" hips, and the small fit well. I'm including the thigh measurement because the legs were borderline too tight on me. If you have larger thighs than mine, I'd go a size up. In contrast, there's enough extra stretch in the waist that these could probably accommodate someone with a somewhat larger waist without creating a muffin top. (Similarly, smaller thighs would be fine with the small but someone with a smaller waist might want to go for XS). No specifics to say about the hips--it fits about right on me and could probably go either way.The pocket is just large enough for a credit card or ID if you stretch it. It's fine for keys. The material is thick but not particularly smooth/soft (like some pricier brands), but it feels fine and looks good. My only complaint is that the pattern in the back seems to minimize my butt (not something I want, but you might.) Overall, good value. I'd buy them again.

B01JLOSNIG	Best quality for cost (reviewed by a horse person)	This is perfect for running and riding (horses) but I'm sure it's great for cycling too! Better than any horse products at a third of the price, so I bought two more. Thick, soft, stretchy, well made, no weird smell out of the bag. Snug fit, so order up if you prefer a less contouring look, but true to size. It moves with you, not tight at the neck.  Temps dropped into the 20s before I needed a coat at the barn. Perfect underlayer for lower temps once you stop moving. Will try it skiing next month.

B01MTKVL55	Fantastic Build Quality, But Not a Good Cycling Fit / Cut	I really, really wanted to keep this jacket. It's well made, feels great, and has a very nice finish.As an avid amateur cyclist, however, fit is very important. This jacket fits more like a regular jacket, not like a cycling jacket. It's loose everywhere and (in my opinion) runs large. I ordered a medium (which was borderline, could have ordered a small) and there was just too much fabric for my 145 lb, 5'9" male frame. It hung off of me like a sport jacket. The sleeves were a bit baggy, and I had a lot of extra fabric in the midsection. I think a small might have even been too big. My chest measures about 37", and my waist is around 30". I measured the waist section and there was 40" of material to go around the waist area. I didn't test this in the rain, I simply put it back in the bag and sent it back.So if you don't mind a loose-fitting jacket (that would work really well as an everyday warm-up or rain jacket), this may be the one for you.If you are looking for a trim cut, or even semi-form-fitting, I suggest that you look elsewhere.

I'm mainly a mountain biker and this jacket is super warm (comfy in the 20's with a light base layer), has a nice fleece interior, and the outer material on the jacket is windproof. I bought this as a cheap jacket figuring that I wouldn't feel that bad if I ripped it catching a tree branch (like I did when I ripped my $150 PI jacket on a ride a while back) Feels like a jacket worth much more than $40.

B01JLOOAH4	Lovely design and fit.	I usually wear size S, but I first ordered size M because I planned to wear a long sleeve underneath and worried about size S being too tight.  The size M ended up being a little bigger than I expected, but I think it would be the right fit for someone who usually wears size M.  I would have returned it and just reordered the size S, but it was so pretty and nicely designed, that I kept the size M to give to my sister (who is taller and has broader shoulders) and ordered the size S for myself.  I am very happy with the long waist fit and how warm it keeps you without being too think or bulky.	S.

B01JLOOAH4	Looks great and feels great	I tried both the small and the medium (I'm normally size small for tops - 5'2", 117 lbs), I definitely liked the small fit better. Some people mentioned that it was too snug. I actually prefer my clothing fitted, so this was perfect. Not too snug and not loose. I bought it for running in cooler weather and loved it so much that I ended up buying another one in different color. Keeps you warm and comfortable, doesn't ride up when you run. It looks pretty also. I love the feel and the look of the material. I also washed it (followed the washing instructions on the tag) and the quality hasn't changed. Would recommend for sure.

B01JLOOAH4	Great buy!	I love this! The fleece lining is great. It will definitely keep you warm on a brisk day, or if you're running, it will keep you warm on a cold day. The fit is slim--I ordered a medium, and it's tight through the chest and stomach (I'm 5'4", 135 lbs, 34D). So, you might want to order a size up . The blue is as vibrant as the photo. The photo looks to have 2 side pockets, but they're actually a single connected pocket (like on a hoodie). There was plenty of room for my phone, without problem. The quality seems really good, although I've only worn it twice.I will purchase other athletic wear from Baleaf! Great product at a great price!

B01JLOOAH4	Good Choice for Night Running in Cooler Weather	I purchased this fleece half zip shirt for night running and it is very nice. The material is soft and stretchy and I purchased a size up (large) because I wanted to wear this more as a coat with just a t-shirt underneath. It is fitting (not too tight though) and a bit longer than I like (I am 5'2 and about 130 lbs.), but the material is the perfect thickness for 30 to 45 degree weather running. This holds up nicely in the wash, but I do not put it in the dryer - hang dry only. The front pocket does not work for me because of how long it hangs down. If I had to put a phone or something in it, it would flop around. This is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5. I do not like the front pocket area - way too large. The front neck zipper, however, is great. It's long enough you can unzip it and feel like you're getting air underneath. The sleeves are long too, which is great for covering up your hands.

B01JLOOAH4	Pretty great shirt!	I'm 5'4" 125 lbs and ordered a medium. I took this on a 23F 6.5 mile run this weekend and was comfortable wearing only a sports bra under it. When I had hills or the wind at my back, I got sweaty, but the wicking kicked in after a couple of minutes. It's not exactly wind-proof, but cuts it down to manageable levels. The sleeves are somewhat long, which is great if you're wearing the cuffs, but the sleeves don't easily convert to "regular" sleeves. The collar comes up relatively high, but for someone who loathes things around her neck, it had ample room to keep me from feeling like I was chocking on it. I LOVE the color; like an electric peach. The kangaroo pocket in front is excellent, though it causes a slight rumple in the sleek front look (it IS a pocket, after all).

It is form-fitting, but as a base layer for outdoor winter activity like running or skiing she loves it. The length and sleeves fit well (not too long/short), which is often our challenge with 4'11". Additionally, the blue color looks brilliant, and the garment shapes perfectly to be close-fitting and very flattering, without being suffocating. She looks fantastic in it!

B019GUI0UQ	Nice cycling pants, very warm.	I really like these cycling pants.  Others mention they do not stretch.  They do stretch a little, but not like cycling tights which may be to what they are being compared.They are very warm.  Unlike my cycling tights which keep my legs reasonably warm, these kept me very warm.I have only worn these for three rides so far primarily because it is getting warmer now and even on my 15-20F rides I was sweating a lot in them.  Granted all three rides were fat bike on packed-snow single track (~10mph ave mostly protected in the woods), but I will definitely be using these for 10F and below fat bike rides next Winter.  Typically below 10F I'm wearing cycling tights, cycling shorts, and my running/XC ski pants, but I think these pants alone (or maybe with cycling shorts) will fit this niche for me.	B.

B019GUI0UQ	Really an amazing deal - if you put a name brand label on these pants they would cost $80	These are really good wind pants - and are absolutely incredible for the money. If you put a brand name on the outside of these pants they would cost $80-$90. I purchased the large first and they were a bit big but I kept them to use as winter pants when using the snowblower. I got a pair of mediums for regular wear and they are perfect. I'm 5'7" and about 160lbs. These things really are amazing in terms of being wind proof and warm. I walk my dogs every morning on the beach in Massachusetts and it can get really cold in the winter, but these pants keep my legs warm. If you are going to wear them to bike ride you probably need to be in a really cold climate otherwise I would think you would sweat in them. One thing I would suggest is that if you are going to wear them for riding and you are going to wear riding shorts underneath (these pants don't have any padding in the rear) then you should go one size up to give you room for your shorts. All in all, an amazing deal.	Regular Joe	Color: Black-1|Size: Large	B01M75DPWG	/gp/pdp/profile/A6VRY887VBCYT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/02/23

B019GUI0UQ	Well worth the price	Good pants, seem to be well made, well worth the money. I'm 6'1" 200 lb, the xl fit well, not loose and not too tight, like you need in a bike pant.  I went on a mountain bike ride at 30 degrees, they were a little warm but the fleece lining absorbed the sweat and didn't become cold or clammy.	devlin1k	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B019GUJ7GM	/gp/pdp/profile/A1MT0L9YUO0N8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/02/17

B019GUI0UQ	Fit remains major issue	This is my second pair of Chinese cycling wind pants, with the Beleaf being a different brand but I wonder if these aren't just all made in the same place. In theory the application of these pants is great, and I use my other pair for fat biking or occasionally mountain biking. Depending on the temperature I will wear a pair of bib shorts or bib tights underneath. With bib shorts and this type of pant on top, I can easily ride down to about 25 degrees F.But...there continues to be a huge fit problem with all these pants for seemingly anyone not short and/or wide. Since there is no experienced apparel design company behind these, there seems to be no concept of how to fit other bodies. I'm 6'1" and wear a 30" waist pant. If you fall into this category of tall and athletic, don't even bother with any of these. The size with the appropriate waist will be too short in both the waist and crotch, and the larger sizes feel like MC Hammer's Can't Touch This pants after being cinched down to your waist (flare out at hips). My other pair is bigger, and I do get by on them, but they really don't fit well.  I know a lot of riders around me who have the same/similar pants from Amazon, and nobody says they fit well.It is really too bad because they are actually made well and the fabric does a good job even if the breathability is a little low.  Pants like these are actually hard to find unless you spend $30 here or $200 elsewhere. It would be great if someone could make a $60 pant like these but make them fit athletic western bodies.

B019GUI0UQ	Best for a slim build.	These seem well made, but they are generally made for a slimmer build. The waist size is about right in XL for a 36" waist, and the length seems OK, however, the fit in the seat and thigh is not a relaxed fit. I am 6' and 215lbs, with, let's just say it, some junk in the trunk. I don't mean I am over weight, just that my build packs some ass. These pants assume a slimmer build.If you are built like me, and especially if you will use these for biking with a padded chamois, then they will be too tight.

B019GUI0UQ	Great for 30-degree mountain bike rides.	Bought these for cold weather mountain biking on Long Island, NY and I'm extremely impressed. After seeing so many other options in the $50-100+ range, I was pleasantly surprised to see all the positive reviews for these pants, at such a low price. I've been on two rides with them so far, both in the low-mid 30s. My legs were very warm while riding, completely comfortable. Just leaves me feeling that I'll be perfectly fine out there as the winter gets colder still.I'm about 5' 8", 155 lbs and the Medium fits great. I like that they're not skin-tight, but are nice and snug around my calves. No issues whatsoever with pedaling a bike. There's a zipper running down the last 6" or so, with it unzipped they feel a little more like normal pants.The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that I can't judge how durable they'll be over time. But so far, two rides in, I'm very happy with them.	Steve	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B019GUHXWM	/gp/pdp/profile/A2XRRB9GD9YAEP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/02/07

B019GUI0UQ	Warm Substitute for Long-Johns	My husband is not a cyclist but wears these pants to keep warm during hunting, snowmobiling, blowing snow, and other outdoor winter activities. They are more form-fitting than he typically wears, but they hold heat better than long-johns. My husband loves these pants and bought a second pair. The pants do run small.

B019GUI0UQ	Nice pants, sizing a little difficult	Baleaf is quiclky becoming a favorite brand of mine- I like their balance of price vs quality. Their men's Windproof Cycling Jacket (L) fit me perfectly, but the pants are a little different story. I'm 5'8, 175lbs, and ordered a Large- the length was good,but it was too tight everywhere else, almost like putting tights on, which doesn't work for me. So I ordered an XL which solved the tightness problem, but now the legs are too long, by about 3" or 4". But if I just do a little inside cuff (flip up the bottom on the inside of the pant leg), they are fine.So these are nice cycling pants and I got them on a lightning deal for $23. But as nice as these pants are for the price, the sizing is slightly odd I think. So I'd say order a size larger than you normally do unless you're really skinny. Also, if you're going to wash them, don't plan to use them for a couple days- they are drip dry only and take a long time to fully dry.

B019GUI0UQ	They work great	I use these for commute biking.  They're quite warm.  They're too warm for 53 degrees, but they are comfy at 40-45 degrees.  I'm confident they'll work well in colder temps, too (I just haven't had an opportunity to ride any colder yet).They are a non-loose fit.  I won't use the term snug because they aren't stretched while worn, but they are definitely a fitted cut.  I'm 5'7", 155 lbs and ordered a size M.  They're a smidgen long, but that just keeps my ankles warm when I ride.  I'd qualify it as a proper fit.They don't breathe very well, which you may expect with "windproof".  They end up quite sweaty by the end of my 7-mile commute.  Turning them inside-out when I take them off gives them a chance to dry just fine.Other details: They do have two zippered pockets (on the front) and a waist tie.  They do not have any padding, so I just wear regular cycling shorts underneath them.  They also have zippered ankle cuffs.

B019GUI0UQ	Great pants for winter!!	Excellent product. I have about 20 miles in them on 2 rides in windy 30 degree weather. Both rides I came back with my legs comfortable and even some sweat. The wind doesn't really cut through these at all which is nice. If it was any colder, i'd still probably wear compression under just to be safe, but would feel confident in their ability to keep me warm either way. I'm 6'2 250 lbs, wear about a 38 waist and ordered the XXL. My only complaint is around the thighs they are a little snug on me, but I have tree trunk thighs. Everything else about them is great, the fit, style, stretchiness and they stay in place really well while riding. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair for myself if I needed them.

Material appeared to be adequate for the challenge of a Michigan winter. However despite following suggestions to order a size larger, the sizing was so far off that I could not fit the pants over my thighs without the possibility of ripping out seams. Perhaps Baleaf is using Asian sizing. If so, the Asians are exceptionally tiny.I ended up purchasing a more expensive but better-fitting alternative from Pearl Izumi.	Michael D.

B019GUI0UQ	Mostly great - some minor fit issues	As a Minnesota all-year cyclocommuter, I need something warm and these pants fit that bill. I am 180 cm (5'11'') and 84 kg (185 lbs) and use pants that are 33W x 32L and I have pretty muscular thighs (avid cyclist). I first tried Large and while they were mostly fine, the pants tended to get pulled down in the back exposing skin there. I got XL instead and that is less of an issue now but still slightly annoying. They sometimes get pulled a little down to the waist which is really the only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5. Perhaps I am just oddly shaped and indeed I generally favor bibtights over cycling shorts for that reason among others. They are not baggy at all and very comfortable. If needed, I could use a thin baselayer underneath them.Then to the performance in cold. As I get ready to brace -20 C with -30 windchill (-4F/-22F) this morning, I am not worried at all. I know they will get me to work without freezing my legs off. Yes, my thighs are a little cold after the ride but not to the point I really need a baselayer as I do with most other winterpants when it gets this cold. They are fine in temps up to 3-4 C (37F) but then they start to get a little sweaty.In summary, these are very good for winter commuting and don't require a baselayer, even when it gets very cold. If they extended a bit higher up in the back, they would be just about perfect.	Kurious Oranj	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A3HJH3OKSFNWFJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2017/01/04

B019GUI0UQ	Well Made and Fit as Expected	I think they're well designed and well made. The micro-fiber lining seems warm, though here in Phoenix it won't really approach cold until Jan/Feb. If you're riding in +-5º of 50ºF you'll sweat. The shell is nicely wind resistant and I expect water 'resistant' as well. Water "Proof".. probably not.At 6'/190 or so, and not lean muscle my waist runs about 36", inseam about 31". XL fits me perfect and I can wear cycling shorts beneath (these have NO pad). But... any larger waist, go up a size (these should do you fine at 32-34). If you're 6'1", these might do for you in length, 6'2" that's going to be iffy.

B019GUI0UQ	Made for the COLD	I really liked these pants they fit nicely.  Im 5'10, 190 34/36 and bought XL. The waist has plenty of strech and the legs are slightly tapered so no worry of getting caught in the bike chain or getting snagged. Now for my big beef: they do not breath!! This might not be an issue if its really cold out? I went riding with these the other day when the weather was 59. Within the first 10 minutes I knew these wern't for me. By the end of a 2 hour ride I was soaking wet, mind you on the inside not all the way through. These pants are great for blocking the wind, keeping the cold out and being water proof but So. Cal rarely gets below 50 degrees so these are to HOT. I ended up buying another brand that is almost exactly the same as Bayleaf but they have material that breaths and isnt nearly as hot. Today I used them riding when it was 55 and came home dry. Btw the other company is "4ucycling"	larry	Color: Black|Size: Small	B019GUI0UQ	/gp/pdp/profile/A1OOOJM6DV2OZL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	1	2016/12/30

B019GUI0UQ	Very comfortable windproof pant with trim fit compared to similar Inbike product	I was so happy with my Inbike windproof multisport pants that I wanted to buy another pair but opted for these from Baleaf that were a little less expensive yet seemed of similar design.  The sizing chart from Baleaf suggested a 2XL would fit me about right, and indeed they do, if just slightly on the small side, contrasted to the Inbike pants in which a 4XL size was only a little bit looser fit.  The sizing charts are hard to compare, especially as Inkbike seems to have changed their chart since I bought my pants a month ago.  But, while I ordered 4XL from Inbike, the order history now says they were 2XL, and that was the size at least for Baleaf that has provided me a good fit.  The price difference isn't so much as to sway a decision on which brand to buy, so I recommend Inbike for a more loose fit and Baleaf for a trimmer fit.  Both brands appear to offer good quality construction that I expect should hold up well.  For reference, I am 5'10" tall, and a not-too-fit 235 lbs., with 32-inch inseam and 40-ish waist.I'll also note that the size of product from Balef that works well for you could vary with the product type...I bought a size XL in some bib cycling tights and found a size L was a better fit.  Meanwhile, I don't think I could go any less than 2XL in these Baleaf pants.Quality of construction when comparing the Baleaf vs. Inbike pants seems the same, both being well made.  The styling on these Inkbike pants is such that they have what appears to be perforated panel of fabric over the thighs, but it's hard to say if this is just for looks or if it adds breathability (noting these are described as windproof).  Again, a cycling test might better answer that question.  As I write this, I"m wearing the Baleaf pants indoors and they feel warmer than the Inkbike, but I think that is just the result of the snugger fit.Sizing of these Inbike pants, should I order another pair, is a question I'll have to inquire about, as it appears Inbike has changed the sizing guide from what was available at the time of my purchase.  Although labeled as a size 4XL, my order history shows these Inbike pants as being 2XL, which the current sizing chart leaves me thinking would be too large.  Perhaps that is the current equivalent of the 4XL I ordered, as I do know that other reviewers said the sizing chart wasn't accurate and the pants ran considerably smaller.  Comparing the Inbike sizing for a 2XL to that of Baleaf, the Baleaf numbers look more "right size", so I'd probably try 2XL from Inbike to see if they fit the same as my current 4XL does.In summary, I suggest that if you want a more snug fit, the Baleaf pants may fit better, while the Inbike pants give a little extra room.  Both are excellent in my opinion, but Baleaf is a few dollars less expensive.  That wouldn't sway me from buying Inbike again though.  The deciding factor is more likely to be one of which best serves the needs of the weather and need for any layering.	D.

They didn't seem to withstand the wind as much as people said, but keep in mind, we live in ND and we have the nastiest winds.I would totally recommend these to anyone who needs a very warm under layer for pants.

B019GUI0UQ	... today and after reading other reviews I am very happy with my size selection	The pants arrived today and after reading other reviews I am very happy with my size selection. I am 5'10" and 150lbs., I ordered a medium and they fit great. I wore them on a MTB ride today and it was 34 degrees Fahrenheit. I wore a base layer underneath (UA) and my legs were never cold on the ride. I almost regretted having the base layer on but did not want to chance it. Great fit and a great pair of winter riding pants.	Chris G	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B019GUHXWM	/gp/pdp/profile/A2IUXBNGJRYM8P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/12/11
B019GUI0UQ	Fit as expected and plenty warm.	Bought these to use while fat biking in the winter in WI. They fit as expected and keep me warm down to 15 Fahrenheit. The fleece lining in the pants doesn't wick water away when younsweat, it absorbs it, so when you stop you feel the moisture and it can feel a bit chilly.

B019GUI0UQ	Love these pants! Make me wish for colder weather so I can wear them...	Love these pants! They are so comfortable that I look forward to rides in colder weather when I would need to wear them....Really, really happy I bought them (and I considered many other similar items on amazon before choosing these ).Have worn them while riding my road bike on rides when temp at start of ride has ranged from high 30s to mid 40s - and have not felt overheated even when temps have risen to high 50s / low 60s during ride.  Think they would keep me warm at temps well below the high 30s. The pants definitely block wind well.Not sure are designed for riding in rain - but I got caught in a rainstorm for 45 minutes at end of a ride and they seemed to keep me dry. The fleece lining is typically very wet from sweat at end of ride (though that does not create any discomfort during ride) - so important to hang them inside out so fleece dries before next ride.Size - I am 6 feet, weight 195, waist 36-38; got the XL which has fit perfectly.I wear the pants  with a pair of padded cycling undershorts under the pants - and even though the pants are very slim fitting the undershorts fit well / do not make pants feel tight / do not make the pants look like they are bulging out in seat (really cannot even tell wear undershorts). The pants are very form fitting but not at all constraining while riding. Zipper at bottom of each leg helps get pants on / off.I wash them in cold water and hang dry them inside out so lining open to air.	kettleman	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B019GUJ7GM	/gp/pdp/profile/AYJ77BRVHKWOT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/12/10

B019GUI0UQ	Excellent for cold to cool weather cycling	As a cyclist I needed some new cool weather riding gear & these are definitely warm! Took a 15mi ride @50deg thinking I might want a base layer but my legs were wet at the end (meant for much cooler temps or cold people)- the fleece lining is much warmer than anticipated, these will definitely be enough in much cooler weather & the fit & styling are just what I look for. I'm 5'9", 155lbs & very trim so a small was perfect even for a skin layer under them.	parentsof3	Color: Black|Size: Small	B019GUI0UQ	/gp/pdp/profile/A3EGSH2YB1PY5P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/12/08

First off the quality  of the pants looks amazing, the fit is good and they perform well in the 28 degree weather I was riding in. I almost ordered two more pair, but decided to give these a try and see how the held up to use. I have used them twice and the small zipper on the pocket has pulled apart. So I sent an email to Baleaf, they first responded with how bad they felt and could I take pictures so they can show their warranty team and either replace the pants or refund, so I took pictures and emailed them back.my next email read along the lines of how bad they once again felt. But asked me if I could take the pants to my local repair shop? WTF!! Never heard of a sewing repair shop. So then they offer me a 5.00 refund for the poor shopping experience(my shopping experience wasn't poor the zipper was), sure insult me some more. So basically I wrote back keep the $5.00 and I'll keep the pants and I won't be purchasing anything from them again. sure price was right, product seems good but warranty and customer service is undesirable.

B019GUI0UQ	Just what I needed	After settling on this product I was concerned about the size. After exploring reviews and Questions & Answers I settled on Large, which fit me (6 foot, 34 inch waist, 175lbs) but a little snug. Yet, I bought these specifically to bike in and I believe that is better than a baggier Xtra Large. I haven't considered returning, I would actually buy the XL just to have the a little bit bigger fit for non biking! The soft fleece on the inside is very comfortable while the outside has protected me from the elements, so far. I went riding on a 40 degree, 8mph day and I was more than protected with a base layer underneath. I considered wearing these without the base layer, but I personally prefer to be warm than cold so decided against it. The reflective parts seem alright, nothing very eye catching so do not rely on that to be seen! I love the length and zippers as they fit over top of my shoes but not enough to interfere with any pedaling. As long as they last regular use and the washes, I am very impressed with the product, especially at the price of $25 (on sale at time of purchase, down from $60.)

B019GUI0UQ	Good Buy, Could Be Better	These pants are surprisingly well-made for how affordable they are. They do a great job of blocking the wind on my bike commute and I've ridden them in temperatures as low as 30°F and they've kept me warm. The fleece lining on the inside is thin, but effective. They aren't the most breathable pants ever and they don't have any zippers or vents to help let more air in when needed... as a result, they do tend to get sweaty by the end of my ride and they take a very long time to dry. A word of caution: When you do take these pants off to dry, turn them inside out when you do or else they'll stay wet for a long time. Still recommended, but not the greatest pants of all time.

B019GUI0UQ	Real Windproof Pants, Perfect For Bike Communting	I am 5' 10" and weigh about 220-225 lbs. Ordered size Large, and fit is just fine. As a bike commuter it's very important to me that the pants are really windproof, and after having used them several times in 32F or colder temps I can vouch for the advertisement claim. The fleece lining inside keeps my legs very warm, too, and negates the need for wearing thermal leggings. All I put on underneath are bike shorts. The reflective elements on the pants are a nice touch, though I don't know how effective they may be. Comfort is very good too, with plenty of stretch and give for mounting or dismounting the bike and just normal moving about.

I can tell you that I am a large medium or a small large, however you want to look at it.  I was somewhat concerned from all of the reviews saying that when they received these pants that they were too tight.  I'm 6'0 and about 185 pounds and these fit snuggly, but not uncomfortably so.  I mean, they're suppose to be cycling pants, right?  I'd recommend if you're any bigger than me, you order the next size up.  Otherwise, these are very comfortable and good-looking pants.	chris flohr	Color: Black|Size: Large	B019GUHV3S	/gp/pdp/profile/A1KA938JL5EW55/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/11/30

B019GUI0UQ	XL fits 38" waist, 34" inseam perfectly	Excellent, comfortable pants. Roomy in the hips and butt and meant for wearing over padded bike shorts. I'm 6' tall, 192 lbs 36-38" waist depending on time of year (I gain winter weight).  34" inseam in jeans. The XL fit nicely in the waist.  Not tight, not loose.  I'm able to fit padded shorts under them. They come exactly to the top of my feet and cover the ankles even when I squat. I'll update this with a test of their windproof and warmth after I got for a ride. Other features, two zipped pockets roomy enough for my phone and lined with a scratch free soft fleece-like material. Ankle zippers for easy on/off. Flat seams so no rubbing on tender bits. So far so good.	L. A. Mahmud	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B019GUJ7GM	/gp/pdp/profile/A1TSJUWUKSZG39/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	7	5	2016/11/13

B019GUI0UQ	Look good but...	These seem like good cycling pants and I'll update this review when I actually get to ride in them in the Colorado fall. I dinged 2 stars because I had to return them for 2 different reasons. I'll probably update that to 4 stars if they perform as expected.First, the right pocket had a hole at the bottom of it. W/E, I got the bad pair. Free returns and quick credit are why I buy through Amazon. Props.Second, the size was a little on the small side. I'm 6'0", 210, and wear a 36 or 38 waist depending on the pants. The XL were just slightly too small to wear with bike shorts underneath. I do have big legs in relation to my waist, so I think the XXL will fit better.	Bent	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A2PX4DWI8NJBIZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2016/11/11

B019GUI0UQ	Nice fit for short ladies	First off, thanks to the dudes who posted measurements and the one lady who posted a pic.  Makes sizing for ladies much easier.  I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly.  It looks like it is form fitting and snug but does have extra room throughout the leg and rear end.  at first I was worried I would not be able to wear padded bike shorts underneath because they were not as baggy as I expected but to my surprise they accomodate bike shorts just fine.  The pic attached is me with a pair of womens Novarra padded bike shorts.  The material is lined with fleece and the windproof material combined with that makes it feel thick and not so moveable but it does stretch and I surprisingly have free range of motion in them with bike shorts underneath.  Should be no problem pedaling on the morning commute.  The length is just right but I am 5'4" and ~130lb give or take, usually wear size medium bike shorts.  Zippered front pockets are nice.  There is a draw string but won't really  need it. Elastic waistband is comfortable and not too tight.  The legs do taper at the ankles but there are also zippers at the bottom.  When unzipped you can expand the width of the ankle cuff to accommodate over boots or just have a looser fit.  Will be great for biking, winter hikes, early am dog walks, etc.  Have not road tested it yet in the cold weather but will update when I do.  Very happy with purchase.  Would buy again.  Wish they made kid sizes.  Also bought one for the hubby.	spock80	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B019GUHXWM	/gp/pdp/profile/A22MBCYCCVDAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	5	2016/11/01
B019GUI0UQ	Great Value Cycling Kit	First impression: I couldn't be more impressed. Excellent value piece of cycling kit. I am 5'9" 145lbs and a size small fits me very well. Close fitting without being constricting. These pants have kept me warm and comfortable down to about 25-30 degrees Fahrenheit on their own but I expect with a pair of heavier weight cycling tights or other base layer I will be able to use these throughout the winter.

B019GUI0UQ	The inseam is good, touching the front of my shoe	My size is 6'1", 166 lbs, 32 inch waist, 34.5 in inseam. I got the large, which is a size up from the recommendation in the size chart. The inseam length is good, touching the front of my shoe. A bit baggy at the crotch, but manageable. There are four pinched pleats sewn into each knee, oddly placed well ABOVE the knee. I did one deep knee bend and immediately burst two pleats on each leg. I didn't want a larger size to avoid more bagginess. I removed the thread from the pinch pleats and now can do a deep knee bend without any binding. On the bike, the large flat seam below the knee tends to ride up over the knee. Having altered the pants already, I sewed removable elastic Velcro stirrups at each leg opening to fit under my shoes. Now everything stays in place, like tights. These pants are very warm and are best for mid to low 40s F and below. Above that the fleece inside gets a bit damp. Baleaf gave me a very reasonable partial refund with no prompting other than this review. With that, and with the stirrups now preventing the riding up, and understanding that these are best for cold rather than cool weather, I have boosted my rating to four stars.

B019GUI0UQ	Good value.	The quality of material used is very good to the point where the pants would provide some protection in the event of a fall.

I bought the XL which are slightly loose around my skinny legs and provide a "mountain bike" type fit.

B019GUI0UQ	I like these pants - here's some measurements to help your size selection.	I read the reviews and wasn't sure whether to go medium or large.  They were out of stock in the large so I got the medium and here are some measurements to help the next person.  I will include hip measurements for the ladies.  Waist un-stretched 29" (max stretch 40" - and that's pushing it).  Hip about 42" un-stretched and 48" stretched,  upper thigh 22.5", ankle cuff 12", inseam 30.5", overall length 41".  I am 6' 1"  - 175lbs and wear a 32x34 pants.  The medium is really at least an inch too short, but doable.  They are also tight enough - looser on the legs would be better.  I have some Adidas water proof windbreaker style pants that have the same inseam and since they don't stretch at all, when I raise my knee pedaling they slide way up my shin.  These have a little more grip because of the fleece like lining and so they don't ride up, but they're tight enough on me (medium) that I would have to pull the pants up a bit at the knees  when I first get on the bike to prevent  them being too tight over the knee cap.  All in all I am going to  exchange for a large.  When I get the large I will update this review with those measurements also.  All of this could be avoided if sellers would measure their goods themselves and add the info. to the listing.  Then we could compare to clothes we already have.  Simple.  That would mean fewer returns!  Which makes for happier customers!  And lower shipping costs for sellers, which means higher profits!Update on Size Large.  The size Large came in today.  Here's the measurements (typically un-stretched):  Waist 31",  waist (stretched) 42",  hips 42", inseam 31.5", upper thigh 23", cuff 12.5", overall length about 41".  Keep in mind these are outside measurements and since they are double layer the inside measurements will be a little less.  These have the additional room I need and I will be happily keeping them.

These fit well, they are close fitting without being tight a bit stiff at first but seem to be breaking in nicely. I wear these with the padded shorts and a crew length wool sock they are plenty warm for me while riding low thirties and below. Any warmer and i would get all sweated up, At temps that would render these not warm enough  I would be having face and finger problems anyway. The pants have a waffle grid  lining that is nice on the skin  but grabby on clothing.Tried them with knee socks and then with tights , they just get all grabby and bound up. Overall I feel they are fair value for the price.	White Goodman	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B019GUHXWM	/gp/pdp/profile/A10P6QU431ZF1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	21	4	2016/03/03
B019GUI0UQ	Great value and fit.	I'm 6'0", 180lbs, wear 32 inseam 30 waist and the Medium size fit great. Slightly loose about the waist but with the drawstring it's not a big deal (if you have a 32 or maybe even 34 waist you'd likely be fine). Fit is great, I powerlift so my quads are bigger than usual but they are by no means tight. I commute daily in Seattle and these things are comfortable down to ~ 40 degrees or so and holds up to rain pretty well. No padding, if you need that wear a pair of shorts underneath. Quality of construction appears good we'll have to see how they hold up over time but for $25 a great pair of pants that would also serve you well hiking/camping in cooler temperatures.	e.p.

B019GUI0UQ	Exceeded Expectations!!	I bought these for my son for his nordic ski workouts.  The fit and flexibility of the fabric looked comparable to a Swix or Craft pant but at a quarter of the price, so we thought we'd give them a try. He loves them!  Comfortable, warm enough for a MN winter, flexible and true to size.  His only request is that he'd like the zippers to go up to the knee so he could pull them on and off over his boots....but since they're advertised as cycling pants, we understand that they weren't designed with skiers in mind.  Overall, an excellent product at a great price.  Would definitely buy Baleaf again	hometeam1521	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B019GUHXWM	/gp/pdp/profile/A2X5AA2GFE0MCL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	5	2016/01/30
B019GUI0UQ	Great pants, great construction and warm wind pants	For me, these cycling pants are best for riding in the 30s or windy days in the 40s.  They fit and hold to the body, I did not have to pull them up and they did not catch the saddle while riding mixed terrain.  The material appears durable and will stretch, the stitching seem to shape material to the body but not like tights or spandex.  These pants for me were rather warm meaning I was over dress for that trail ride however when the sun went down, so did the temp, they wicked the sweat and I was warm and quite comfortable while friends were headed for their trucks.	horsehead	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A1L8I7CIV7JZTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	10	5	2016/01/25

B01N8ZKEAY	but not to the point of being bad. They are great	I normally go for 2XL as I am 5'11 235lbs (mostly fat, not muscle) but read multiple people's reviews saying they prefer a size down, so I tried an XL. These fit very similar to the other brand's 2XL's I have and are actually a little loose in the arms, but not to the point of being bad.They are great. Love the feel of the material and they are great at keeping me warm biking here in Wisconsin.On a side note, I also bought the full legged bibs to go with these and the bibs in XL feels about the same as XL of other brands I've tried, so I will need a size larger of them compared to the top.

B01N8ZKEAY	I would recommend only 2 modifications for this back pack	I would recommend only 2 modifications for this back pack. First, a slightly rigid back support system to aid in breathability. Second, a separate location to store the waterproof cover. Preferably located at the bottom. One that is already attached to the backpack. Therefore, you need only to pull it out of its storage pocket and cover your bag while raining.Now this may sound like I'm dogging this backpack. However, I really like it! this bag is great for adventure cycling. Longer rides or just making a fun day of it. Has plenty of pockets for keys, wallet, even appears to have a small sleeve pocket for a life straw. Cudos! Enjoy the adventure!

B01N8ZKEAY	Works well for me as a form-fitting jacket for road biking	This is a form fitting jacket when ordered at the 'right' size, since I use it for road biking this is exactly how I expected it to turn out and I was not disappointed. I can imagine the some people want it semi fitted but then you need to size up accordingly. Personally I would like the sleeves to be a little longer but I have no issues with how they are. The pockets are not overly deep either but for such a light top I think the risk of overloading the pockets might grow to be a factor too.I have used the jacket on a number of outings and have been very satisfied with how it performs and stands up to cleaning afterwards, I would certainly consider another.

B01N8ZKEAY	I like it.	I was skeptical about the product at first.I read reviews before purchasing it...Some said, too small, the zip is on the wrong side, Asian sizing, OK product, too small, and everything in between.Mostly 4.5 5 stars all over tho.Pros:the length of the sleeves are actually nice and long. Exactly as expected!The top of the zip part where the collar is, its slightly loose but nothing to worry about.The length on the torso is very good too.Its got the little glue sticky stays.-------------------------------------Does it come from Asia?The sizing is off?The zip on the wrong side?These are things I have not noticed.There is a chance when you buy online you will have to return it.All in all great product and would recommend it and would buy it again.One thing to look out for maybe its true or not, not sure.I was going to get the 2 XL and that is what I ordered and that is what I got.So for me its a win-win. Fits perfectly.Some say, if you are a L then get an XL and if you are a XL then get an XXL (2XL).Always one size up.	Farkas.A.

B01NAIAB6M	The Fernleigh Track on a cold Autumn morning.	The Baleaf Men's Full Zip Long Sleeve Thermal Cycling Windproof Jacket, is great value for money. I am 5' 7", about 150 lbs, ordered a large size and it fits perfect. The quality of the Baleaf jacket fabric is very good and provides great protection from the wind and cold air. I am currently using the Baleaf men's jacket, together with a Spotti men's long or short sleeve cycling jersey, when I cycle along a bike track called, The Fernleigh Track, in Australia. (Google "Fernleigh Track", if you are interested to know more about it). Starting between 6AM and 7AM in the autumn mornings "DownUnder", can be quite cool and wearing the Baleaf jacket keeps my body warm. As my body starts to warm up, it is great to be able to unzip the Baleaf jacket to allow the surrounding cool air, to penetrate through the Spotti jersey, keeping my body cool. The three pockets at the back of the jacket are a great addition. I recommend buying the Baleaf men's jacket. Regards Stephen.

B01MYNI0FC	So sad!	This is my second purchase from this brand, and again the quality is lovely, however the sizing is off. Every shirt I own is a size L and I normally swim in XL tops. I also have several coats in size large, but decided to size up to an XL to fit a sweater and a few extra tummy baby pounds. The shoulders were very generous and overly large (which is odd because I do have broader shoulders). The tummy however, I couldn't get it zipped!!! My current Under Armour infared jacket is a size L and fits better (albeit not as warm) than this one. I'm beginning to think it's a brand issue, because I have pants I purchased with the same issue. I was so excited to find a well priced, quality brand that I could switch to. Looks like it's gonna take loosing 25 lbs to get there. Cheers to that day!

Cycled home yesterday in -15 C with - 25 C windchill and was very comfortable. It extends longer down the neck in the front than some of my others which is very important. It also works well in warmer weather. Even above the freezing point, my head does not overheat. Currently my favorite under-the-helmet winter headwear.

B01N1I0B2G	Drip Dry Only!	I really like the feel of these on my skin and they are comfortable and definitely NOT see thru, however, I deducted one star for the fact that they are machine washable but "drip dry" only and "do not use fabric softener"....  this is 2017, ain't nobody got time for that! Besides that, they sent me an XS even though I ordered a Medium....however, they fit, albeit tight, but not so tight that I can't wear them.....I actually plan on losing weight too so no big deal really. I would recommend them. The pocket is a nice feature on the waist band but probably not big enough for the average smart phone.

B01HXIXKVM	Sizing is misleading. Go a size above the guide.	Wore it once and only once. Sizing runs very small around the waist.

B01HXIXKVM	Finally found what I was looking for....	Hands down, one of the best investments I've made in cycling clothing. I never heard of the brand but gold star ratings given by others lead me to believe this was a product I had to try. I purchased a pair, fully expecting to return them as I have with so many other brands that simply just don't get it. Many of the other brands crotch and bottom area would be so over cushioned it looked like I had the worse case of hemorrhoids known to mankind once I had them on and even worse when I mounted my bike. Not with the Baleaf brand. Designed and tested in Italy, I knew the quality would be there. Made in China (oh no!!) but don't let that deter you. Quality is evident throughout this product, like the YKK zipper at the ankles and the nice grip of the pants at the bottom. The size was spot on. Pure comfort. This company must have one heck of Quality Control Unit at every stage of the manufacturing. What did I do next? Since they were on sale, I ordered 3 more pairs and then picked up 4 of their shorts. I finally found what I was looking for at a sale price to boot! TIP: Save the bag the product comes in. Large and clear with a good zip lock seal. Perfect for all your other camping or cycling gear while on the road.	Ramblin Rob	Size: X-Large	B01HXIXN9G	/gp/pdp/profile/A1OE0G4PBFQF9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/04/11

B01HXIXKVM	Perfect fit for my frame.  True to size. Well made. Perfect for cycling.	I bought the xx-Large size.  I am not a small framed guy.  I am 6 feet tall with a 30 inch inseam and my waist is currently 42inch.  These fit me perfectly and the waist actually had some room in it.  In the waist I could go down maybe one size, but my thighs, calves and ankles fit perfectly, and would not change a thing.  I am glad they are not too tight in the waist.  No draw string in the pants.  The padding in the seat is about 1 inch thick and very good while I am in my road bike saddle.  Durability will be seen, and I will try to update this review when I have a couple hundred miles on them with my bike.As for quality, the material is smooth and the stitching is well done.  The zippers are tight and the grip band around the ankle to keep them from riding up is a nice touch.  They are a bit higher in the waist in the back, so you wont be showing off the plumbers view while leaning into the downhills.  Not sure it is really going to help with the wind, but I immediately felt warmer with them on.Well worth the $28.  I'm going to get a pair for my wife now.  You can buy these and not worry about much.	M. Claude	Size: XX-Large	B01HXIXP94	/gp/pdp/profile/A1SP0JKOZLVYNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/03/16

B01HXIXKVM	Good stuff.	Not bad at all! Adds extra padding where necessary, without any pinching or crowding in a region where such things are particularly detrimental. Worn for 2 hours on the first day, they don't do much for warmth, but they're a base-layer material anyway, so wear something wind-proof and fleece-lined over top if you're out in the snow on a fat bike.

I am a size 8(true 6-8, not larger American sizes) and the medium is very tight on me. I don't own a large in anything so am not going to order more. If you have thin legs they probably are fine.

B01HXIOU1G	but for now I will need to order a 2XL like I've been wearing of other brands	I normally go for 2XL as I am 5'11 235lbs (mostly fat, not muscle) but read multiple people's reviews saying they prefer a size down, so I tried an XL. I regret my decision. These fit exactly as I would expect from XL, which are a little too tight for me at the moment. I will keep them since I plan to keep losing weight, but for now I will need to order a 2XL like I've been wearing of other brands.Aside from the size issue, they are great. Love the feel of the material and the padding for my bottom seems better than most of the other cheap bibs I've tried from amazon.On a side note, I also bought the long sleeve top to go with these and the top in XL feels about like 2XL of other brands I've tried. The sleeves are actually a little looser and longer than I'd expected.	Robert K.	Size: X-Large	B01HXIOU1G	/gp/pdp/profile/A1CT1RIR5AM8OD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/05/01

B01HXIOU1G	Fits decently enough, stitching coming undone after 8 rides.	Well, as others have suggested in order to ensure they aren't "too long", I ordered a size smaller.  They fit my thighs/calves and waist just fine, BUT, they are still just a tad too long, fortunately it's manageable.  They are comfortable and warmer than I thought they would be, the fleece is comfy as you know what, although my legs did get cold and cramp up on the 35-40°F days, wind can also be felt through them (in 15+mph winds that is) that's my fault though, no wind breakers on.The chamois is ample enough to cover all the man-bits, but my butt cheek bones :) are mostly exposed, as the butt-padding is a tad too high up the tail bone, and/or not wide enough nearer the cheek bone area.  Adjusting my seat for a less aggressive posture helps with this though.  It's also padded enough for my tender rear to have no other pains after a 20+mile ride, 3 days in a row!  Considering I've not cycled in 12 years... yeah... my butt isn't used to it anymore... so that's saying something! :)My only real complaint... and this is a big one... the stitching is coming undone already.  I only purchased 1 pair (haven't used this brand before), and have worn them for 8 rides now.  The stitching that's coming undone is a seam on the right thigh area where there's an "X" seam.  Everything else is holding up well, but I'm afraid (no pun intended lol) that it's just a few rides/uses away from more coming undone.  I'm going to contact the seller and find out what to do.

B01HXIOU1G	Sausage apparel	My first cycling bib. I was surprised that the part above the waist is made of very thin and light material that is not thermal at all. I assume that they are all like that. I am 6'2 with pant size 34/34. I ordered large, based on the size chart, and don't like it. The pants are really tight and the bib cuts into my shoulders. I look like a sausage with these tights. For folks who are all bone and muscle this might work. Everybody else, buy a size up.

B01HXIOU1G	A good product!	I read the reviews about the product being sized small, so I ordered the XXL. I have large quads and calves, so I'm glad I did. It fits snugly but more-or-less a perfect fit. I am about 5'9 and there's no sag in the straps. I'd say if you are 200lbs, have large thighs and calves you want to order the next higher size. Quality is very good. I'll probably buy again in the future.	Beej	Size: XX-Large	B01HXIOUYS	/gp/pdp/profile/A21LQAN4CZNHTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/03/26

B01HXIOU1G	Excellent purchase!	I purchased these thermal bibs for my husband for Christmas. He's been cycling in them for a couple of months now and LOVES them. He even prefers them over his Castelli bibs, and at a mere fraction of the price that's pretty amazing. We live in a chilly and wet climate and cycle at least 3000 miles per year, so our winter gear is important. Good quality and affordable cycling clothes...who knew?!? I'd definitely buy again!

I wore these on a 55+ mi ride with a starting temp of 49F and they were very comfortable. I like the bib and stirrup style better than my cycling tights as they stay in position and don't ride up or down on me.  I wish I found these earlier in the winter season.

B01HXIOU1G	Should've bought L and XL to compare overall fit vs. excess length	>> Followup:  I ordered the size L and compared it to the XL, finding as did the other reviewer, that I was happier with the L and will return the XL.  The shoulders a slightly snug but I expect them to stretch out a little, then they should be perfect, while the legs are now short enough to not have the excess that I had to overlap on the XL. The perfect fit for me might well be right between these two, but as I lose way, the L will fit even better and more comfortably I think.<<I should have ordered both XL and L sizes, then return the worse-fitting of the two.  As it is, I went with an XL size in spite of another review of a buyer who at 6'1" - 250lbs. found size L more to his liking.  Going from the waist size guidelines and being 5'11 - 240 lbs. with a 40-inch waist, I decided to stick with the XL size.  The fit in the torso and shoulder straps is supremely comfortable.  Not as snug as my Performance Ultra bib shorts, but I hope snug enough.  I may yet still order another pair and try the Large size, but will keep these for now to see how they work out.  The length is the main issue for me, the legs being long enough to be easily folded/overlapped by about 1.5 inches.  Slack fabric invites cold spots, so hopefully I can minimize that by folding up the excess length in the legs and pull socks up over the fold to help maintain it.  I'm not sure, but if these work out well, I might consider hemming up the excess length above stirrup, so it remains functional.	D.

B01HXIOU1G	Quality bib pants, better than more expensive ones I've tried before.	Winter is coming, cycling gear can be really expensive and since I'm on a budget, I thought I'll try this. I've been on one 70 mile ride on this, and it was extremely comfortable. I felt warmer than I do in usual lycra so I guess the thermal part is true. With tights, you sometimes have a problem of them running up but that is prevented with a hook that goes around your fit. I ride a fair bit and I've tried a lot of bib shorts but after the first ride I noticed a significant difference in this; I must say it's my favorite bib pants now. I'll update this review if I ever have issues but so far so good.	Akshay Venkatesh	Size: Small	B01HXIOR0A	/gp/pdp/profile/AIPEV7BFKW5YT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2016/10/16

B01N0DP2K0	Longest pants I've ever purchased.	I was super excited to find a lower cost exercise apparel brand with winter gear. I've ordered several items and found the sizing to be off. Unfortunately, really and truely unfortunately, these pants are not the exception. While the XL waist (I normally wear L tops and L bottoms) finally doesn't squeeze my tummy, the rest of the pants are HUGE!!!! Being 5' 2" I regularly deal with longer than desired pants, but it's normally not a big deal. I have tons of sweats, leggings, and swish warm up pants that skim the floor, or slightly pool at my ankles, but aren't unwearable. These pants were totally unwearable. They were so long I had probably an extra 6-8 inches of material with no prayer of rollong them up. Tall girls, these are your pants, get them. Short girls, stay CLEAR! I've got a big package to send back to Amazon, and I'm so sad about it! Doesn't seem like this brand has a good feel for L and XL sizing, so sorry bigger gals!!!!

B01IOJ14B2	Close, but no Cigar!	First of all, I don't mind the somewhat large fit.  I do Pilates and the sometimes large movements are easier to do in looser clothing.  The great thing about these pants is I have very long legs and these FIT!  The downside is the feet.  They are awkwardly gathered and look strange and feel strange.  They just don't fit right.  If Baleaf were to fix the fit on the feet, these would be a gold medal winner.  As it is, I'm still looking for the perfect workout pants.

B01EYK1MPS	Cheap and fluorescent color -- but pockets!!	CONS- So the "coral" shorts were actually bright fluorescent orange.  I'm not picking as I usually wear mismatched running outfits but be aware.The shorts are made of thin plastic like texture material with tiny holes throughout. The pocket stitching already appears to be coming undone. Overall the materials are cheap and I expect durability to be poor. It always says to drip or hang dry I believe.PROS-I can fit a stinger waffle in each pocket.  This was THE reason I bought these shorts and success!! This along w a race belt w a small pocket allowed me to carry five waffles to fuel my marathon last week.  The waffle packaging did jab me as I ran due to the thin material tho.Update:  the seller gave me a partial refund even though I couldn't return the shorts since they were worn- much appreciated! I even purchased another pair since I'm worried about durability but love the huge pockets.

B01EYK1MPS	I think they thought of everything.	I am a fitness instructor, and an avid runner, so I was asked if I would evaluate these shorts, at no cost and sent directly from the manufacture. I take this privilege very seriously, because I believe I have a responsibility to deliver a thorough and objective assessment.  Additionally,  I do not promise to deliver a favorable rating or review, nor was I asked to "contact" the seller if I have any issue.  I received this sample for evaluation, because, I believe this is a new product (style and design) for Baleaf, recently added to their collection of fitness apparel.This is my first pair of this particular kind, as I generally prefer a compression bike short, typically with a 5 to 7 inch inseam for all my summer exercise needs.  I find they are, on my curvy figure, most flattering and comfortable.So with an open mind I gave these a spin. While other's command us to "Just do it!!!"  Baleaf offers us the freedom to choose to "just do it for way less!" Giddy up!I did some research into these type of shorts, as well known brands that sell this identical short.  What I found was they can charge twice as much, perhaps because of name recognition.  Let's be honest, most of us have overpaid for our workout apparel, telling ourselves it is an "INVESTMENT".I sad to admit, am Guilty!  This is from a gal with an extensive wardrobe of official "ZumbaGear" and even with deducing my discount as an instructor, it would still only make those $75 cargo's $48? So I am the first one to admit, I used to buy brand names before considering quality.  Now I am just left with a bunch of mediocre apparel that I avoid wearing and a tummy ache from all the hype.I am now a mother of three and turning 40 next year....so I am trying to make wiser choices.  Since fitness is such a big part of my life, the money I put towards fitness apparel is a huge consideration.I may share silly antidotes, but I try to provide the information I look for when I am shopping.  So here are my personal "need to knows" with regard to these shorts:I like how they have "spankies or lollipops" (as I used to know them as in high school cheer) basically it is just an attached pair of brief panties built right in!This is new to me, sorry.  I personally do not enjoy wearing fuller coverage undergarments, so it will take me some adjusting to.  It makes perfect sense though, preventing my booty cheeks from hanging right out!  More importantly keeping "other people's booty cheeks" on the inside of their shorts, just where they are supposed to be.They did not rub, or irritate, like I thought they might, after my trial of these.  Please be aware that is based on casual exercise, a few 3-5 mile treadmill runs, and a 5k flat run, not a marathon.  For that "marathon level" insight, I am not your girl. 😬 Nor have I ever measured my quad muscle, and I probably won't begin doing it now.  If my jeans button....."I'm good" but if they don't "time to eat clean and hit it harder for a few weeks".  That's why I provided a visual of my fit, because I have never stuck with a diet or "official program", just not my style.  It has never been effective for me, personally.I admire and respect those of you with the disciplinary and motivation, tremendously though.I have NEVER BEEN skinny, nor would I consider myself an athlete.....at all!  It wasn't until after two of my three kids were born did I stop dieting, and just made better choices concerning my health, and the weight fell off.  (Omg that sound so annoying....) but that's just simply what happened. Now I am (arguably) fitter than I ever was growing up.Back to the shorts, while my personal preference is for 5-7 inch inseamed compression bike shorts, I surprisingly feel just as comfortable in these. Who knew?  It flatters without squeezing, the drawstring and elastic waist allows for the wiggle room, and in my experience prevented the dreaded muffin top.  Skinny and voluptuous women alike, old and YOUNG all contend with the topping off of one's muffin.It's ironic to be trying to lose the muffin top, all the while sporting one?  Not in these babies!Are they for your though?  Well if you are legit on the fence, you can relax a bit knowing that with today's consumer friendly market, you can undoubtedly recoup your losses, no harm no foul.  Then take pride in the fact that you tried.  As far as I'm concerned, the fact that your reading a review for Baleaf's running shorts in the first place deserve a token "get it girl!" True that!In the photos I try showing the sewn in spanks, and the deep pockets. The material is softer than I thought it would be, I really like it.  The black pair's accented with bright pink, which is made that particular shade for reflection (I later learned)  Safety considerations while running outdoors.  They thought of everything.  Well, everything I can think of. I would definitely recommend these shorts.  I like them so much, I plan on buying them in Orange and Pink as well! Thanks for taking your time to read my post.

B01985TMFG	Perfect cycling cap	I recently purchased this for riding my bike outside during the Winter season. Went out on a ride on a 40 degree, 8mph wind day and found this cap to be exactly what I was looking for. It kept my head warm and caught the sweat that usually runs down my face. Also, I wore it without a helmet ( I know, I know) and it was "fashionable" enough unlike some other caps I have seen on here. The slits for glasses are placed pretty well. It might take a little practice to put them in without any problem; first few times I went straight into one side but under cap instead of the slit. Fit my head just fine, I can't see it being a problem for most average sized head humans....Material seems durable and washable. I would be interested to read what a snowboarder or such would have to say about it, but for me this is what I needed. I do hope to be able to use it in colder temperatures, though I am thinking a full face mask would be more adequate for those rides. For price and how well it has performed so far I am giving it 5 stars.I would only change if it doesn't survive after regular wash and use.

B01985TMFG	Great cap for warmth that fits nicely under bike helmet!!	My husband had found that his new stocking cap was too thick to fit under his bike helmet and he suffered a great deal in the 30-40 degree weather this Winter since he would always choose safety (helmet) over comfort (warm hat).  He was so happy to get this thermal cap - it's super soft and fit his head nicely with the elastic bands not being too tight to cause any headache - and it has two reflector strips on the backside to help with visibility while biking/running at night.  He wore it under his bike helmet recently while on a 6-mile ride and this cap kept his ears warm and it stayed in place, not needing to be adjusted at all during the ride.  We think it's awesome he now gets the best of both worlds of Safety and Comfort while out biking.  We received this product from Baleaf at no cost and would recommend it to others looking for a cap to keep you warm during sports such as biking or others that require a helmet. You can have the best of both worlds with this cap!	D & A Falcao	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A64ORSVIUKNAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/03/17

B01M626XK2	Baleaf Women's 3D Padded Cycling Tights Pants...	These are very nice cycling pants!  The material and the padding is perfect--great quality!  What was not perfect is the sizing--as in really large for an XS.  So what did I notice about the XS that was so large? I found that the zippers would have to rolled completely under in the legs to fit me in length.  I am petite.  Also, there was "extra" material that wrinkled on my back side--posterior--to be exact--that I did not fill.  I wish these came in an XXS because then I think they would fit me.  They are very nice, and I would love to keep them if they fit me.	K. C.	Color: Black/Hot Pink|Size: X-Small	B01MFXGK9P	/gp/pdp/profile/A1V8OCWOYQ4JXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2017/02/12

B01M626XK2	They are not super tight around the ankles	I have not worn these on a ride, yet. My initial review is that they fit well and there seems to be adequate padding. They are not super tight around the ankles, but I have skinny ankles so maybe it's just me. I like that there is a pocket with a zipper and some reflective piping.UPDATE: wore them on a ride and they kept me warm and comfortable. The padding is perfect! Still wish they were a bit more snug around the ankle but they didn't ride up my leg so that is just a minor complaint.
