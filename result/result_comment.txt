B005SG0GYG	Decent fit, thin fabric, Amazon sent the wrong color	I don't know why I wanted a long dress as a "pool dress," but I did so I got this inexpensive one.  The fit is pretty good, not too clingy and not too loose.  The fabric is on the thin side and, although I haven't worn it yet, I'm pretty sure it will pill easily.  My biggest complaint is that I think they sent me the wrong color.  I ordered the grey and the color I got looks almost like a denim blue.  It also smells very strongly of that stuff they spray on returned clothing to disinfect it so I'll have to wash it before wearing.	tlicious	Size: Medium|Color: Eco Grey	B005SG0H22	/gp/pdp/profile/A3525IITFUAFFF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/07/29

B005SG0GYG	the fit is OK, loose through the top, fitted through the waist and hip	This is an OK dress for the sale price that I paid. I am 5'6" and 144lbs. I ordered a large, I am curvy though the hips and this dress fit through the hips and waist.  The length is right for my height.  The thing I did not like about it is that the arm holes are too large and the neckline came a bit too low (side boob and nip slip too loose/low)  So the straps need to be shortened or I will always have to wear with a tank top.  The material is pretty thin so it's see though when the light comes from behind you. Since I got it for this 100 degree weather, the thin material is fine with me.  I don't plan on going out to eat in this dress.  It's pretty much for hanging around the house, etc.	Amy	Size: Large|Color: Eco Grey	B005SG0GYG	/gp/pdp/profile/A9GU5XG8B3GYV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/07/17

B005SG0GYG	Not that great.	I originally ordered a S. It was the perfect length (I'm 5'7") but I exchanged it for an XS because I have a smaller chest and it fit a bit funny in the chest area. Well after washing the XS, it shrunk and it is now Capri length on me. Material isn't the greatest -- it's a hard cotton and pretty see through. Thank goodness I didn't spend much on this dress. Word of advice, buy from Amazon because they offer free returns. One of the biggest drawback of buying clothing online is that you don't get to try it on before purchasing.

I could probably sleep in it if I wanted, but so far I've layered it various ways to wear to work (good with a tailored jacket or layer a tunic over with some jewelry). I'm 5'6" and if you are any shorter you might need to hem it: I do need to gather it when I go up stairs but it's kinda fun. Super comfortable. Casual on it's own but easily dressed up. Well worth it. Loose enough to be forgiving of my little tum, but fitted enough to demonstrate I do in fact have a waist.

Bummed me the hell out bc it is a nicely cur dress. Quite long. Thin breathable cotton with a little stretch. Perfect for summer. It could be dressed up or down. This is going to need a cold wash and lint rolling. Idk if it came from Hondurus (where it is made) like this or someone returned it like this but if they did theyre pretty trifling.

B005SG0GYG	Absolutely LOVE this dress	Absolutely LOVE this dress!!!! Ordered the eco navy blue one and couldn't be happier! I'm a size 10/12 and 5'9". The medium fits perfect! It's extremely flattering and can be worn casually or dressed up. It's thin fabric so it's perfect for warm weather.  I had to laugh reading some of these comments about the bottom not being hemmed. Ya, it's not. But it's a maxi dress! You can't even tell--and it doesn't matter. I've ordered more in different colors. Great price, great dress, and it arrived quickly.

B005SG0GYG	Simple, But Elegant	The only reason why this dress isn't receiving a five star rating is the material is very heavy to wear in heat.  In an air conditioned environment, it would be absolutely perfect.  I live in Northern California where the summers can be very hot and dry, and I am not comfortable in clothes that seem heavy.  Other than that, the design of the dress is just perfect for someone that is looking for a dress that they can wear to work, shopping, or social settings.  The color is perfect, and accessories, for the dress, is endless.	Pattik	Size: X-Large|Color: Eco True Navy	B00EO86SO6	/gp/pdp/profile/A2AMO4UX48DU1P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2016/08/09

I love this dress, and the brick red color is very cute.  You can dress it up with flats or heels or you can wear it with boots and a jean jacket.  It looks great both ways!

B005SG0GYG	Great dress (even after 2 years) but Seller---please hem them!!	I have bought this dress multiple times because I love it so much.  The fabric is fantastic, very comfy and not too see-through,  cut large enough in the tummy to be forgiving.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that these are unhemmed!  As others have said, they are very long (which is great because then you can shorten it to your desired length) but after spending $25 for it, unless you can sew or don't mind an unfinished hem then you are looking at spending another $20 to get it hemmed, and that makes it an expensive dress.  I am 5'6" and these are long on me---about 2-3" longer than the floor!  But they are all purpose---you can dress them up or down.  I just love mine.  I wish they came in more colors, like white, and were hemmed. I've had mine a long time (like 2 years now) and they wash up well, no pilling and very little shrinkage or fading.  I am normally a size 6 (busty 36" so trending towards an 8, not a 4!) and the medium is perfect for me, not too tight.  If you are a smallish 6 or a 4, then go for the small size.

I am generally somewhere between large and XL but I opted to buy the XL and I should have bought a large, reason being, if its warm out it tends to stretch out a bit.

It also tends to get dragged down a little by its own weight and show a bit more cleavage.The good: This is the perfect, casual, "I just happen to be sexy" maxi dress. It clings to the right places, makes you look curvy and willowy, and oh, if only it came in better colors, I'd buy so many. Hide your heels under this thing, and the vamp factor goes up.

B005SG0GYG	Perfect dress for tall women	I purchased this dress recently after purchasing the blue.  Perfect dress for tall women.  Lots of room, very airy and light.  Comfortable casual wear that can be dressed up or down.	B@bb$	Size: Large|Color: Eco Grey	B005SG0GYG	/gp/pdp/profile/A1NG3UJOD66F7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/10/16
B005SG0GYG	Comfortable but too revealing	I ordered the grey one, like the model is wearing and it is very long on me! I'm 5'6 and 125 lbs and the neck comes all the way down PAST my cleavage. The side openings come down past my bra and the hem drags at least an inch on the floor. I think the body of the dress fits me well so if I order a smaller size it'd be too tight. Since I wear a headscarf the issues of an extremely low neckline aren't too much a problem. I also bring up the neckline a bit with a safety pin so it isn't hanging off my chest. That is the only way it can look the way it's pictured. Some things I do like about this dress are that it's a soft fabric and it doesn't wrinkle. Since the fabric is light, it does not hide much of what's underneath. Keep this in mind if you are self-conscious about your body or do not want to be worried about imperfections while wearing it. Despite all this, I do like actually like this dress and wear it often.	D.E.	Size: Small|Color: Eco Grey	B005SG0H68	/gp/pdp/profile/AG4IRYG4VIR43/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2015/10/07

But this dress is way too long you have  to be 6'2 to fit  right. It's OK on the waist but chest way to low, I need  take off shoulders about 4 cm to place it rught on the body . It's definitely not a regular fit size! !!it's for really  tall people and even if I got S wouldn't change the fact of the proportions for hight . It's just for very tall. It's also  dragging to the floor. Color I like, material is OK (not super  but ok) , soft, easy on body  but  seethru kind of. Not sure send it back or just  donate it. It's not possible to wearing this dress as it is. It's need a lot of alteration! Not recommended it! Never had problem like this before.

B005SG0GYG	Careful around those curves!	I bought this dress for my wife, it is very sexy and form fitting. She is 5'3", 125lbs, with 36dd's. This dress does a great job accensuating her bust, hips and butt, the only problem is that it is very long. Even with heels on, a couple inches of the dress are draped on the floor. I guess I would think that with a size small, it would be a little shorter, but what do I know?  Unless you are 5'5" or taller, you might need to be prepared to hem the bottom up a little. That is the ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Other than that, it is very sexy, and is very complimenting for a woman with curves.	Charles A.

My boyfriend said it's seethrough when I tried it on, but it's not as bad as others that I have. This type of lightweight fabric will always et some light shine through. Since this dressfits away from your body in the skirt, it's not going to be as obviously transparent as more form fitting dresses.

B005SG0GYG	Cheaper on Amazon, but still not worth it.	I sought this dress out after seeing it for double the price on Zappos. Literally, it was twice as much. Seeing that Zappos was selling it for $68 I made the unfortunate assumption that it MUST be good quality. Well, we all know what happens when assumptions are made, right?!I am incredibly picky about fabric quality. And by “incredibly picky” I mean “For the LOVE OF COTTON! Why can’t anybody make a garment of medium weight fabric that doesn’t show everything?” There’s nothing I hate more than when you can see the perfect outline of my body through my dress because you can see the light between my legs. I feel like that’s a terrible way of describing it, but you get it, right? If I wanted to wear a bodysuit in public, I would. But nobody wants that.The straps are too long, the armholes gape, and the hem is unfinished. Is it comfortable? Sure. But I can go to Target and buy comfortable clothes from China for cheaper. I know what I want is out there, because I’ve purchased it. Last year I got an AMAZING dress by Alpine Design from Sports Authority, but it appears that they’re not continuing to make them. Had I known that it would be near impossible to find another solid color maxi dress that’s well made of quality fabrics, I would have bought out their entire stock.  The hunt continues. Recommendations welcome.	Leshell	Size: Medium|Color: Eco True Navy	B00BM82MNW	/gp/pdp/profile/A61Q78KR7X2SK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	15	1	2015/04/01

B005SG0GYG	It shows a little more cleavage and side-boob than I am comfortable with so I wear a came top underneath	Based on the other reviews I was expecting the top to be slightly big, and it was. It shows a little more cleavage and side-boob than I am comfortable with so I wear a came top underneath. After washing on cold and air drying, the length actually shrunk. I am 5'5", and it went from skimming the floor to being about an inch off the floor. I like both lengths so that was fine. The top didn't shrink though. For reference, I am 130# and I bought the small. It is fitted through the mid section,  not tight anywhere else.

B005SG0GYG	nice simple dress,  with a reasonable price	I bought a small thinking that it might look a bit tight but it's fine not a body hugger (could have taken xs if you want your curves more showing),  but for me I'm fine with it. I'm a bit short 159 cm so the dress length surly is more than maxi to me,  the fabric is fine, finishing is OK ,  but it is not stitched from the feet side of the dress, I have to take it to a trailer to do that for me.The only thing that really made me unhappy about it,  is that they deducted it's price twice from my visa,  when I complained they(amazon costumer care) said it's the bank strategy and the money will be back in my Credit! But until now no one gave me back the money,  and for me I'm charged twice for it.	huda sammour	Size: Small|Color: Eco True Navy	B00BM82M00	/gp/pdp/profile/A2F3QO0IH39XU5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	3	2014/08/21

B005SG0GYG	Nice basic black maxi	The dress is very black (eco true black) and the material is a very nice weight. I didn't find it 'see-thru'...backlit by the sun certainly you could see outlines of my legs, but the skirt has some fullness to it so nothing to be overly concerned about. You can always wear a slip. I ordered a medium based on other size charts since I couldn't get the one for this dress to load, but a small would have been the correct size. The staps seem to be a bit long in the medium (for me anyway) and there is a bit of a fullness around the waist. It doesn't look bad, just had to keep hiking up the straps until I tied them up in the back as an emergency halter neck. The unfinished hem isn't even noticable. The length just hit the top of my foot with a flat sandal. I am 5'6", 127# , 36A, 29 waist, 36" hips (hopefully that helps someone choose the right size). I washed the top in hot water-got some wash out of the dye but not really fading of the dress. I did the bottom 1/3 in cool water hoping to prevent it shortening too much since the dress is 38% cotton. It didn't seem to shrink at all so I guess I should have exchanged it for a small if I wanted it to fit a little tighter. Good thing is no worries about undie lines with a medium. All in all, it is a very nice casual dress which dresses up nicely with a little shrug. I may order it in a different color and a small.	D.

B005SG0GYG	Fit great, but not black	The fit was really good with the sizing a good description.  I ended up returning the dress though, because it wasn't really black.

B005SG0GYG	Great dress!	I randomly found this on Amazon and decided to order it and I love it!! I'm 5'5 and usually a size 12 and ordered a large and it fit perfectly.  It is very flattering and hugs in the right places, just loose enough around the tummy, but a nice fit on top and everywhere else.  A lot of reviews said this was super long, but I didn't think so.  I'm only 5'5 and it hit right at the ground which I like because I hate short maxis. Also, the unhemmed bottom is not bad at all, although the material is a little see-through when you're standing in the light, it's nothing a slip can't fit.  Awesome dress, great fit and it came really fast.	M.S.	Size: Large|Color: Eco True Black	B00EO8AWXO	/gp/pdp/profile/AYUKAO2ZMML2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2014/06/09

B005SG0GYG	Great, with adjustments	This is my first maxi dress and mostly, I love it. But that's after I: 1) chopped two or three inches off the bottom hem (easy to do because it's unfinished to start with and rolls up a little to hide scissor jags), and 2) sewed crude little folds into the tops of the shoulder straps. I'm 5'7", 145 pounds, 36B. Bought a medium. The arm holes were pretty gappy and it dragged too much on the floor before I did those things. But now I've got it on and it's soooo cute and comfy! I like the eco navy a bunch (it's as pictured), and I've come back to order eco black, in small. Seems like I've got enough room to try a small, and I'm slimming down for summer anyway.

B005SG0GYG	Ahhhh comfort!	This dress is soft and fits perfect. I'm 5'6 and 175 lbs , just had a baby and this little dress hugs me in the right places while still being forgiving of my pp belly. I will by another!	Jaymi-Reigh	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/AIPSLA4DNWUGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2014/05/19
B005SG0GYG	WAAAAY TOO SMALL!	The 5 star rating is for the awesome customer service, I mean AWESOME!!  They promptly offered a refund due to the high shipping cost from US to China.  However, my suggestion is that the company include a US and European sizing chart to avoid all of this back and forth anyway.  Most Asians are smaller than most Americans and Europeans, and this dress is made in China.  It arrived with out tags of size, fabric/material, washing instructions.  It was like straight out of a ...... shop? I don't know, but the bigger issue is how tiny the dress is. I ordered a Women's size M and it looks more like an XS ( no exaggeration).  The customer service however, BLEW ME AWAY>  They were Sooooo nice to offer me a full refund for the trouble.  Thank you soooo much!

B005SG0GYG	Not Alternative Apparel Brand	Items ships from China, which is a red flag. Dress isn't even an actual "Alternative Apparel" name brand as described and pictured. Its not even close. I own the same  Alternative Apparel dress in another color, and this isn't even the same material. I'm absolutely amazed people haven't caught this discrepancy. The name brand tag on the dress doesn't even say "Alternative Apparel". I mean, c'mon, if your gonna try to pass something off as an original at least get the tag right. Only positive is seller refunded my money in whole when I complained and it was prompt, which is why I gave 2 stars.  They didn't even try to defend there product. Seller, please, please don't list this as Alternative Apparel brand, because it is not.	Paul Nichczynski	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A1NEHKY5WTU740/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	40	2	2014/05/17
B005SG0GYG	Inconsistent hem lengths among colors	Love these Alternative Apparel dresses, but I ordered both the eco navy and eco grey in Small, and they were different lengths. Unfortunately I didn't realize this until I tried on the navy and used that as a guide to cut both. I'm 5'5" and had to cut about 3" off the bottom of the navy, so it would hit the top of my foot, but when I cut the same off the grey it ended up above my ankle. My advice is definitely to try on and wash before altering the hem! Small fits great on me and I wear a size 4 in dresses.

B005SG0GYG	Perfect length for being tall!!	I am in love with this dress, got it in the black- I am six ft tall and it fits me perfectly! Haven't owned a dress that was more flattering and made me look very feminine; I have a D chest and this dress makes me feel fantastic and is so comfortable!!! The dress sits about 1.5 inches off the ground or so while wearing flats. I am in love, it feels like it was made for me! I even paired it with a knotted button up and jewelry for my office job, I get compliments almost every time I wear it. Getting another one today!

B005SG0GYG	Very Comfy	This fit as I hoped it would. Not a lot of stretch after the first wear so duplicate wears before a wash. Looks cute with a belt and I received a lot of compliments on it. I am debating purchasing the black and navy but wish it was a little less than $30. I hope to be getting a lot of use out of it for vacation.

B005SG0GYG	Busy Mom - Ordered the large	Every weekend I am running to and from kids softball games, birthday parties, visits to grandma, the grocery store, you name it. This will be my go to for the Spring/summer/fall months because it can be dressed down or dressed up or worn as is and still be appropriate.  I LOVE the racer-back design and fit!  Buying it in every color today.  To give you an estimate of the sizing, when I purchase from Walmart, I order a large (US 12/14).

B005SG0GYG	cute dress...too long	The dress is cute, good material...but with my 5'3" frame, it is too long in the neckline, torso, and at the ankle.	Sportej	Size: Small|Color: Eco True Navy	B00BM82M00	/gp/pdp/profile/A223BO5YZDZCAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2014/04/28

B005SG0GYG	No shape.	The only reason I am rating this high is because the shipping was much faster than anticipated. But the dress itself is a stiff material and has no shape. It looks horrible. I got a small and if anyone smaller than me got this it would be too big. I was expecting something much different. :/ I wouldnt recommend this dress to anyone.

B005SG0GYG	read before buying	Fabric is too thin and will need to be layered.  the hem is unfinished and look terrible- ugh!  waste of money!	S. Camos	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A3VJO93ZGZ91PR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	2	2014/04/18
B005SG0GYG	Surprised by the off sizing	I am 5'4" 120 lb-ish and a D cup.  I usually wear a size 2/4 or small so I just ordered the size I usually get with all my clothes.  The length was too long, I mean, even with heels.  I've got a nice "situation" on my chest and was shocked when the bust was waaaay too big for my ladies.  I'm constantly pulling it up and readjusting to prevent getting arrested for indecent exposure!  The material is jersey so it will pill with washing, but is nice for lazy days when I just want something to lounge in.  Warning--panty lines will show through this so wear a thong, sheer, or no panty line underwear with this.  It's also stretchy.  I am pregnant now and I have grown into it somewhat, but even with prego boobies, the bust is still too loose.  All of that aside, I still like it as a house dress and wear it often.

B005SG0GYG	Soft, Casual and Cute	The price was right so based on most of the reviews I decided to try it. Originally I planned to use this as a cover up for my swim suit but I also plan on wearing it around town in summer. Yes, the hem is unfinished at the bottom but doesn't bother me. I'm 5'7" and the length is just right - not too long or short. Will work with flip flops or flat sandals. I wasn't sure if the neck line would be too low for my taste but was glad to see that it's not. The fabric is soft but not too sheer or thin. I ordered the Eco Grey and it looks very similar in person compared with the photo.

B005SG0GYG	Love this dress!	I love the look and feel of this dress! It has a great shape and flares in just the right place. My only complaint is that yes, the armholes are a bit loose -the sides of my bra are visible, but I'm on the busty side so this a common compliant with the current fashion trends- but this can be easily enough altered. That said, I will likely order another in a different color.	Coyoteblue	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A3T9E4VBZZ6F49/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2014/03/26

B005SG0GYG	what a piece of crap	this is an absolute waste of money, it was so sheer even doubled it was see thru.  Don't order this, you can find the same dress for $9 at a Ross's or similar store.  And I wish I would have read the description better to realize it was an UNFINISHED HEM!!!! Who does that?  not only is it not worth spending extra money on to get it hemmed by a professional but its too expensive to return.  DON'T ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR!!!! The black doesn't even look like a black, more like a faded blackish grey or material that has been left out in the sun too long.  This has got to be the cheapest, flimsiest material that I have ever seen....$38 gone down the drain....an expensive cleaning cloth it is....wouldn't have given it a single star if there were an option of NO STARS....	angel	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A1QPPEI5NKD41Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	1	2014/03/13
B005SG0GYG	Just as it promised	I really liked this dress, the color and the shape are exactly like the image.

B005SG0GYG	Great dress after alterations	I was looking for something that was comfortable to bum around in on vacation that was still cute enough to wear to dinner.  I am 5'8" and I ordered a small.  I am having it altered to have it fit better, but even with the alteration price, it is still a very affordable, cute, and comfortable dress.  The material is thin, so the lighter colors may be a bit on the see through side, but I ordered it in black and I'm very happy!

B005SG0GYG	As expected but color different from expected	I agree with all other posts that the dress is long, but otherwise fits as expected.  My one slight disappointment was the color.  I thought it would be a light grey as in picture but it is more of a blue/grey.  I was hoping to use on safari for lounging around at night but not sure the color will be okay because of the blueish tint.

B005SG0GYG	Comfortable but will only last for one season.	The dress fit just as I expected it to. It hugs in all the right places. It's good to where for a casual outing and is very comfortable. The quality is not that good. Even when washed on a delicate cycle in cold water little lint ball appeared. I think after a few washes it will become a "lounge around the house dress only".

B005SG0GYG	Better in person :)	I have been an Alternative Apparel fan for years now and am skeptical about sizes due to different fabrics/styles. I am 34C bust, 27" waist, 31" hips and about 5'6" and this in a Medium fit me perfect! Its quite soft as well and washes nice with only slight (and I mean slight) shrinking. It is long on me, but then again I like things kind of dragging on the floor. A Small would've fit fine to, but I love the way the Medium flows more on me (like the model in the picture). I bought the Eco grey and its exactly like it is in the picture. I am soooo glad I bought this dress! It'll definitely be my go-to Summer dress (I may just live in it;) ) Purchase it, you will NOT be disappointed!

B005SG0GYG	So comfortable	Reasonably priced (I ended up ordering another color).  This maxi dress is a perfect length (I'm 5'10") and a lovely shade of purple.	M	Size: Large|Color: Eco True Prune	B00B7YH3H6	/gp/pdp/profile/A3P63WPE9JD9M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2013/08/10
B005SG0GYG	Careful on fit	I have found that I love maxi dresses as part of my office wear.  This dress has a very nice feel, and I love the tank look in the back. My only issue is, and this is so weird cuz it's usually the other way around, it's actually slightly larger in the fit than what I would classify as "medium." But I wear a sleeveless shirt on the top, knot it in the front, and then it's difficult to see how the slight bagginess under the arms.  I would definitely buy this maxi again in another color, but I'm going to try "small" the next time.

No hem at all.  5" longer than my other maxi dresses.  It will cost $18 to hem.  The size and color are o,k.  The promise of free returns not true.  I have to drive 25 miles to an Amazon box.

B005SG0GYG	Not sure about fabric quality	I like the fit but the quality of this fabric is not great and I have doubts about it lasting very long. I have found that this is usually the case with Alternative Apparel, which is why I never pay full price for any of their stuff. The black looks like a really dark grey now that it's been washed once on delicate and line-dried. The grey one I purchased had some pilling going on, but again, I've only washed them once. It's not terrible for the price, but this is definitely a one season sort of casual dress.	LadyS	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A29OABXZHFBMFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	3	2013/07/19
B005SG0GYG	Nice dress but material is thin	I am about 5'5'', curvy with a D cup.  The dress fit well.  A little long so I wore it with a wedge heel. I am over all happy with the dress however the material is thin.  This dress will not take kindly to being stretched.  On me, it gathered at the lower back.  This would cause the area under the arms to gather as well.  I found myself constantly readjusting this and pulling the bust area up so I would show too much of the girls....  It's a nice casual dress to run errands in.	christy	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A2QY7KQV8AN0XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2013/07/12
B005SG0GYG	Cute and comfy	When I originally received my order, the wrong product was in the package, but I called the 800# enclosed in the package and they emailed me a return shipping label within ten minutes.  I taped the original packing up, dropped it in a mailbox (that's right - the mail instead of having to go to a UPS store - I loved that convenience!) the same day and had the right item within a week.This dress is a light, stretchy t-shirt material with a nice, raw edge.  The raw edge doesn't look sloppy - it's cute and casual.  It's just a very easy piece to put on and feel pulled together without having to put too much thought into your outfit.  I have to wear a heel because of the length, but I like the longer look.	mom-shopper	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A3H241YYOSKRDP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2013/07/02

B005SG0GYG	So comfy	I really like this dress, I'll probably order more in different colors. Very flattering. I bought a small and it fits perfectly. I am about 5'7" and I can wear flipflops with the dress and the hemline doesn't drag on the floor. I also have an athletic build and am about 130lbs. So, while a little on the snug side, I don't mind because it really looks nice. The heathering in the gray is also a little forgiving. Great dress.

B005SG0GYG	Great Maxi Dress	This dress fits true to size. It has a slight a line shape and it fitted at the top which is very flattering.  I like the racer back style.

B005SG0GYG	Not the greatest	I have to say I was disappointed in the fit of this dress. The length is very long which for some may be great. I'm 5'7 and it drags the floor a lot. My main complaint is the size of the arm holes or length of the straps, however you look at it. The holes are very large. If I knew how to sew I could cut the straps, shorten them and resew them but that is not a project I will be taking on. The left strap on the black is not sewn straight either. (I ordered the black and the grey)  The material is also very very thin. I do not wear this out if my house. This is strictly a lounge around the house dress which is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1, it's good for when I get out of the pool and need something very lightweight to throw on. Should have returned it but didn't want to pay return shipping.	Nichol Bergen	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A2OAN57IZEVMO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	76	2	2013/06/11
B005SG0GYG	Perfect maxi dress	Could not be more happy! Fit is perfect. Slight A line, so it's faltering if you have some curves. I bought this in black and had no issues with it being too sheer. It is very long; I am 5'7/140lbs, purchased a medium and it hits the floor. I like having a bit extra so I can wear a wedge with it. Dress is easily hemmed if needed. Fabric is not heavy, but same as any cotton/spandex tank top fabric.I found this as a positive since I wanted to wear this at an outdoor summer event.	stephaniefreed	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/AW1YQ6SM5XUEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	5	2013/06/09

B005SG0GYG	Not what I expected at all	Misleading description, this is not a jersey dress such as advertised it's more of a sweatshirt/sweatpants material. I was quite disappointed for the price this was and it also came with no tags or anything which was fishy to me. I did receive it promptly and appreciated the quick delivery. It fit nicely so I decided to keep it as run errands type of outfit but I will not be wearing this out again it looks very very cheap.

B005SG0GYG	Great length, but a little sheer!	I bought this in black.  It is a great, casual piece, perfect for summer.  I'm 5'10 and the XL was plenty long enough, actually even too long, the L would have been fine.  The only issue with it is that in bright sunlight, it's kind of see-through.  It needs to be layered with something else, otherwise you may end up thinking you're more covered than you are.	C E L	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/AEZN61ALRZDM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	53	3	2013/04/19

B005SG0GYG	fabric too heavy	I have this same dress in Medium and color grey. The Medium is a bit too loose on top and I thought the Small would fit better. This is not the case at all.The fabric is too heavy for the length of the dress and pulls the top part so far down it doesn't look good anymore. While at first it seemed like the Small exactly the same size as the Medium, it now even seems as if it's bigger. Doesn't make any sense.Since I'm at an APO, sending it back for a refund via USPS would be too costly so I'll have to spend even more money on getting it altered in the end.Not pleased at all.	mstadler	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A1LG5T2I15BR8N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	2	2013/04/15
B005SG0GYG	Finally!	Few things to point out about this dress..Material feels cheap-ish, but I don't mind because I have been searching for a dress with this type of material as my "go to" dress, plus, it's really fresh..Another thing, I am 5'7, 135lbs with D chest, and the medium is perfect..Then length, AWESOME! I mean, finally a nice, truly long "maxi" dress..One thing that threw me off was that in the upper chest area, although it fits perfect, the arm hole part, looks a bit big..Imagine how a tank top looks when it fits big on you in the arms ..Other than that, I love this dress and I just may purchase more in other colors..I recommend..

Then there is the wonderfully soft textured fabric that is more detail revealing than a wet T-shirt contest! Every protruding crack & crevice is no longer a secret & highlighted in soft, clingy gray!

B073D4YV9P	Super cute	Super cute, but it's not very thick. I don't think it would withstand a school year abuse with books and all kinds of stuff inside.

B073D4YV9P	Nice size	So I'm not sure why this has so many negative comments and reviews on the size of this backpack. I bought it for my 7 year old who is smaller in size and it honestly seems a little big for him but as far as not having enough room in the bag I see no problem. It would easily fit a few books, folders and lunchbox. JMO tho!! A little pricey I thought, but it is UA and that's what he was excited about so i guess that's what matters. He picked the green and black bag and the colors are awesome! And with it being mostly black you won't really be able to see the dirt I'm sure it will accumulate. We went with the cheap $10 Wal-Mart bag last year and it didn't last half way thru the year without falling apart. I hope this one lasts at least thru this year without any problems and a 2nd year would just be icing on the cake!	geotraxmaniac	Size: One Size|Color: Graphite/Black	B016CA08OE	/gp/pdp/profile/A26XQ63UXLMBMT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2017/07/10

B073D4YV9P	Quality is worth the price when it comes to backpacks.	I've had this backpack in my cart for months now and I've watched the price fluctuate. It started off at $44.95. When I saw it went down to $22.95 I jumped on it! And boy I'm glad that I did.My son will be in second grade this fall and he is in love with UA items. It's hard for me that he doesn't want Paw Patrol or Hot Wheels backpacks anymore because they're not "cool" :( But over time, I've learned those character backpacks don't last a whole school year anyways - sometimes you need to spend a little more money for a quality backpack that will actually last.I love the vibrant colors, we chose the navy blue and bright orange. It is a perfect size for a school aged child.I will update as time goes on of any issues, but as of now it is a great purchase and I will probably be ordering another one in the near future for my other children.	911Kaitlin	Size: One Size|Color: Royal/Blaze Orange	B016CA07MM	/gp/pdp/profile/A510GFZQONEXJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2017/05/29

B073D4YV9P	Perfect bag for my son	My son loves it. He is a fairly big boy and going to Middle School next year. This is smaller than his current backpack but adequate enough for what he will be carrying. Product is made of good quality of course and Red and Black are his favorite colors. The straps seem very comfortable just in case he has to carry heavy books. For the price, this will be worth it and expected to last a long time. It has the perfect amount of pockets. This bag seems perfect for children in both Elementary and Middle school.

B073D4YV9P	Really nice pack!  See the review for it's pros and cons!	This backpack seems very durable!  That is the top thing I look for in a backpack...aside from side water bottle pockets.  Side water bottle pockets are why we replaced our son's Jansport pack with this one.  I do like all of the different pockets.  There is a laptop sleeve.  There is a place to put a device that has a fleecy material for non-scratching.  The shoulder straps are padded and seem comfy.  The bottom material is thick enough to hand wear and tear.The use of this pack is to go to our classical conversations group once a week and for traveling.  I expect the traveling to really show how tough the bag is.If I had one criticism the pack doesn't seem super deep/fat. If you were toting a laptop and trying to cram a lot of books in there I am not sure it would be able to do it.  The other packs we have are a bit fatter.  I think this one is still larger than the one we replaced, though, and our son is not toting a laptop for the considerable future so no problem for us!  It was just worth noting!If I have helped you I would love a helpful vote!  Thanks!

UNACCEPTABLE for something that retails so high	jeff	Size: One Size|Color: Royal/Blaze Orange	B016CA07MM	/gp/pdp/profile/A1KLH7JV5MV6C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	1	2017/02/20

B073D4YV9P	Heavy duty backpack. Worth the price.	Good heavy duty backpack. This is the second one we have bought. My son used his other one for two and a half years. It was still in pretty good shape until he forgot a banana in it and it got smushed in one of the pockets and he didn't realize it until it started smelling a week later. We have tried cheaper backpacks and they start falling apart in weeks. I would recommend this one.

B073D4YV9P	GREAT backpack!	My son is a huge fan of under armour.  The backpacks are expensive, but well worth the cost.  We've had less expensive ones and ended up having to replace within a few months of daily use during the school year.  These are going on 5 months of use now and still look brand new!  I would highly recommend.  My son is 10 and on the shorter side and this fits him well and is able to carry all he needs for school.  We also got the matching lunch kit which I would also highly recommend.	ssmith	Size: One Size|Color: Graphite/Black	B016CA08OE	/gp/pdp/profile/A19OEZ6DJB2EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	5	2016/11/29

The medium size pocket is the perfect size for a lunch box/snack bag.Hopefully she still likes it in a few years!

B073D4YV9P	Great backpack for 8 year old	My 8 year old loves Under Armour.  We've been through shirts, pants, shorts, shoes.  We used a drawstring bag this summer for the pool that was amazing.  He needed a new school bag and so I went with this one.  We got black with green.  He loves green so it was perfect for him.  It's well made and durable.  The Under Armour shirts never hold up and are not worth the cost.  The shoes are wrecked in less than 6 months.  But this backpack?  Its great!  A full recommendation.	A.

My babies are sadly growing up too fast, so I decided to switch from their usual Pottery Barn backpacks to something more "grown up" this school year.

The material looks durable and easy to clean...and they have several colors to choose from.  Definitely a great buy!

My 7 yr old wanted a big boy backpack for 2nd grade and as much as it broke my heart to not order a Pottery Barn superhero bag this year I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with our purchase!  He picked this color and based on other reviews I felt confident this bag would be the right size for him.  It arrived quickly and in perfect shape!  This picture is from the first day of school so the bag is almost empty but it gives you an idea of what to expect as far as the sizing.  Would buy again!

B073D4YV9P	I thought the quality for the brand would be much better than this	Unfortunately, I thought the quality for the brand would be much better than this.  This was for my son and although the size was appropriate the quality was not close to what I expected Under Armour to produce.  Plastic type feel, depth was not suitable and there was an overall lack of attention to detail.  I have received better backpacks for less than what the price of this pack cost.  I did return the package because of this as well as it being to small to hold 1 binder and a lunch box for school.

B01GPL0B4M	Perfect for nurses	I am a nurse, and I am on my feet for 12+ hours a day. I NEED shoes that are comfortable, have good arch support, and that are good in my already bum knees and lower back.. I had never own UA shoes before, and honestly I was pretty skeptical.. But I decided to give them a try. These shoes are amazing. Where other shoes don't have enough arch support - these shoes have the perfect amount. Where other shoes are too narrow in the toes, these shoes were wide enough to not give me blisters at all. Since wearing them, my knees hurt less and I don't mind being on my feet as much as before. I am buying another pair for at home too.	Lauren Formico	Size: 7.5 B(M) US|Color: Orange	B01GPKZ3MS	/gp/pdp/profile/A2KR6M5L69QC42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/26
