B00OPZJDO0	Pick up a second pair, because you'll be able to bike a lot more than you used to!	When it comes to good biking gear, going cheap almost always means choosing a poorer experience, but I can safely say these shorts are on-par with the two main-name-brand bike shorts that I have tried, without a doubt. These are very inexpensive and fit nicely as advertised. They are breathable and add a generous amount of padding to a region that, after a couple bike rides on a hard seat/bumpy road, REALLY needs it! I can safely say these shorts are the single reason why I was able to go from biking 12-16 miles every other day or every few days, to being able to do it comfortably every single day. You might want to pick up an extra pair, because you'll be able to bike so much more, you might need them!

B00OPZJDO0	These used to be "Great Inexpensive Riding Underwear Helped Me Enjoy Riding My Bike Again!" But not so much now, read on...	Please Read My Update Below:Original Review: I'm an overweight bigger guy, 6'2, 240 lbs., 49 years old. I recently started riding again. First ride around the neighborhood, without padded shorts -miserable. It kept me off the bike for months. I bought these shorts and decided to try it again and was able to ride 6.6 miles, twice in a day (that's a half running marathon folks!). Honestly, there's still a bit of tenderness afterwards, but vastly improved so that I actually really enjoyed the ride and continued with it. I plan to also purchase a padded seat cover to help more too. I wear a size 38-40 waist in pants and shorts. I ordered the XL size and it's just right for me. After a few uses and runs through the washing machine, they're still holding up really well with no signs of wear yet. I'll be purchasing more of these.Civic/Consumer Duty Updated Review: Because I liked my original purchase of these riding underwear so much, I left a very favorable review when I purchased a second pair from the same seller and listing based off of my prior purchase. I expected to get the same product. No! The current purchase only slightly resembled the original purchase. The material and padding seems to be the same, but the differences with the recently received package are a very small waist band, elastics leg bands added, and no side support stretch stitching.There's enough of a difference in my comfort and ride now that I will look elsewhere when I need to purchase a new pair. I'll attach photos that I'm sure will be helpful. Know that the original pair I like better is the one with the large waist band and grey side stitching. If you look closely at the photos, you can see the stitching on the newer pair is of much higher quality too. Also, the photo may make the padding look like it's concave, but it is actually convex on both pairs. Please also know that the older pair has been used several times (held up very well) and the newer pair has only been used once. If I could be guaranteed to receive the original pair, I would quickly purchase it again.

B00OPZJDO0	Great dirt bike or street bike shorts for those long rides.	Order a size up then normal. I'm a xxl and got the xxxl. They fit perfect and I can wear them over my underwear to get multiple uses. They fit great don't sag and aren't too tight.  I used them for my dirt bike and for my sport bike. They have great padding and breathe very well.  High quality fabric that doesn't give you swamp butt. I'm able to wear them over my under wear and take them off once I get to where I'm going. I was very happy with this product. There's not a lot of shorts made for ridding motorcycle s as far as comfort. Most shorts are geared towards protection. These are awesome for dirt bikes or street bikes.	Anthony B.	Color: Green|Size: XXX-Large	B00MTE6LU8	/gp/pdp/profile/AJJYUMGYWEAZH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/06/16

B00OPZJDO0	OK, If You Don't Mind Riding in a Thong!!	These biking shorts are not the best I've ever worn.  Much too loose.....not enough elasticity.I don't like the feel of the spongy padding in the crotch.Worst of all, they ride up on my legs when I ride.  I had to constantly pull them back down.  Thisriding up makes for an uncomfortable ride.  I felt as though they'd almost become thongs.I see a lot of folks here like them.  I don't.  I don't recommend them at all.	Len E.

The are comfortable and the only clue that they are different from any other undershorts is that you are more comfortable on the seat, especially in a long ride. The construction is very good.

B00OPZJDO0	Good intro into padded bike shorts for the price	So first time buyer of this type of product; just a casual biker w/ the occasional 17 mi ride to work. I've got friends with $10k+ rigs who swear by these type of products. I figured for the price I would try them out and I swear these are a game changer. If you don't ride all the time and are a "tenderfoot" like me, then these inexpensive shorts are for you. 4 stars only because I feel as if the more expensive name brands have higher quality gel pads. But these shorts are extremely comfortable. I'm 6'1", 200lbs with a 34 in waist and XL fits but could be a little more snug in my opinion.

B00OPZJDO0	surprisingly good!	surprisingly good!  i was concerned about sizing, and unisex.  The sizing is accurate.  strangely, they fit me (male) well with great stretch and fit in all the right places.  the padding is quite effective and comfortable.  good touches, like the leg openings have a tacky rim to keep them from riding up, etc.  the waist doesnt ride up.  I honestly cant think of many ways for them to be better except have a zipper / fly (men) but with the padding i understand if that wouldnt be possible.  so impressed I purchased 2 more pair.

I ju	I read a lot of reviews and looked in to several different options. I have a pair of pear izumi  thigh length padded shorts for comparison that I've worn for a few months and they are perfect. I just wanted to try something not so long on my legs as I wear shorts over them anyway. (no underwear under these types of things, have seen that in some reviews and don't understand at all why someone would do that)  These shorts from baleaf are shorter and more like underwear. They are  padded well  and look cooler (who cares for under your bike shorts ) but there is no grip at the leg openings so these shorts just right away ride up and every couple minutes need to be pulled back down into place. Not fun while trying to enjoy your ride. If they added some elastic to the leg openings these would be great but as is I can not recommend them to anyone.

B00OPZJDO0	grip is good	I ordered an XXL about 6 months or so ago and I liked them.  I have since tried two other styles that were slightly less expensive (actually, one pair was about 1/2 the price) and I didn't like either of the other style.  I just ordered another one of these and I finally realized why these are so much better.  These have a grippy band around the end of each leg that does an adequate job of gripping the legs keeping them from riding up.  Neither of the other styles had this and they both rode up badly.  This time around I ordered an XL.  Either size seem to fit me just fine because they do stretch quite a bit.

B00OPZJDO0	Surprisingly nice for what they cost	For most of my riding I wear nice bib shorts. But every once in a while I wear baggies, or do an extended session on a gym bike due to foul weather. I have to say, it's pretty remarkable how nice the pad is in these things for what they cost. I've worn them for upwards of 3 hours of riding with no complaints. I'd prefer the legs to be longer because they are just that perfect length to ride up, but this hasn't affected the pad's comfort at all for me. And I've found that if you put a pair of long-legged compression boxer briefs over them they stay in place perfectly, which solves that problem. Overall, a great deal.	sgniwder99	Color: Blue|Size: Medium	B00MTE6NEW	/gp/pdp/profile/A3A8AP1T33IWID/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/12/07

I still wear them to ride, but I still get numb sensations on short rides. I even have a nice seat. The seat made a far more noticeable impact than these shorts did. Still, for the price, they are great to use as atheletic shorts and are designed for bikes.

B00OPZJDO0	Maybe you should keep looking...	These are pretty uncomfortable. The fabric is thin and doesn't feel strong like bike shorts need to be. The padding is too soft on the top layer, and way too tough in the middle. It is certainly worth spending a bit more cash on proper bike shorts from a reputable company like Cannondale (which I own), Pearl Izumi, or Castelli.11/22/16 Edit: The company emailed me and is refunding me, so good on them!

Fun fact, they are pictured inside out, You wont actually look like the Tony Stark's Robo-baboon, it's just solid black. Also, it fits snug, which is a good thing, prevents the padding from moving while biking and you can hide them under a pair of shorts, so you don't look like an idiot like some of those other road warriors who pretend they are in the tour de France.

B00OPZJDO0	but on longer rides (20 miles+) I noticed that the padding was too firm and actually caused some pretty major pain	I never thought I'd end up writing a review for what are essentially padded underwear, but here we are. I recently (within the past 3-4 months) started cycling for exercise. Initially I had trouble getting used to the rather unforgiving seat on my new bike, so I replaced the seat with a more padded model. This worked for a while, but on longer rides (20 miles+) I noticed that the padding was too firm and actually caused some pretty major pain. As an experiment I bought these and one other (cheaper) pair to see if they'd make a difference. Boy did they ever make a difference, and because I had another pair to compare them with, I found that these are vastly superior. They stay up and wear pretty much like a normal pair of boxer briefs. They're so comfortable that I often forget that the padding is even there. Best of all, no more pain while riding. These things are great.One note is that although the sizing numbers are accurate, the letter sizes are way different than normal American men's underwear sizes. I wear normal Hanes boxer briefs in XL and had to buy these XXXL to achieve a similar fit. So be careful when you pick your size.

B00OPZJDO0	Updated review	Update*Excellent customer service. They reached out to me and offered a refund in which I asked for a larger size and mentioned that they would submit my response to the design team. The XXL came and although still a tad smaller than i'd like, they are wearable and am happy about the overall customer experience. Only docking a star because of the size chart needs to be updated.Not much of a complainer but these things were terrible. I wear Large sized underwear and I bought XL for a little extra room. Well, there was none... felt like these were cut for women. One of the most uncomfortable rides i've ever had and constantly adjusting and pulling on them for room, surprised the jewels were still there at the end. Thought they may stretch and break in a little after a couple miles...nope Glad I didn't impulse buy a few pair.

The waist in the back did not rise up as high as I am used to in bike shorts, and the padding front-to-back seemed a little , um, short. Maybe a XL will fit all this. I am 6'4" and 205 lbs, with a 36" waist. Puzzling thing on the size is I also ordered a pair of Beroy bike shorts (which look for all the world to be from the same company, but probably manufactured by a different maker) and a L in those fit me fine.

The waist was pretty comfortable (i.e if it had pockets and I put things in there it would probably slowly fall). If I go a size up it will be too large for my waist, but it will will fit my thigh. I thought large would fit, since they're fitted for asian type bodies, like Uniqlo clothes (which fits me fine at slim). May need to find something in person. I was hope this would fit me =(.

B00OPZJDO0	Not Well Suited for Those with Gluteal Atrophy	I'm writing this review on behalf of my husband who had hip replacement as a result of cancer. The surgery caused gluteal atrophy and he has been having a hard time sitting down because of tailbone discomfort. These shorts were purchased in hopes they would offer cushion to his backside so that he can sit for longer periods. Unfortunately, it didn't work. The cushion did not cover the areas that hurt him most. However, he feels these shorts would be great for the purposes they are truly intended for - cycling or motorcycle riding. For that reason, I'm rating it a 5 although it did not meet his medical needs.	Jay	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A2OSXJVTJEJF17/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/09/18

B00OPZJDO0	Great road bike shorts for the money	I was drawn to these shorts by the low price relative to other similar bike shorts and needed to replace some old shorts from another company that were showing their age and no longer providing the support I needed. These were a bit awkward when initially putting them on with the padding feeling a bit like a diaper like other reviews have mentioned. I like how they feel when riding and have had these for over 3 months wearing them every time I've ridden my bike. They are a tad shorter than I would like, which is why I rated them 4 stars and not 5, but I guess this is to be expected since intended to be underwear shorts. I originally overlooked this, which is my fault, but for the price these shorts are a great value. I paid $15 for mine and am tempted to pick up another pair at the current $10 price even though I do not anticipate needing to replace mine any time soon.	Scott B.

B00OPZJDO0	Great for the price, fits and works well.	I bought these as an alternative for shorter rides. So far, they work well, I've used them on a 50 mile ride with no issue (although the ride was not non stop.).FIRST IMPRESSION:They fit well, up on your waist. It was at first uncomfortable, but in a few rides they felt much more better. They need some time to "break in". The padding is blue, and it has enough in the right spots, and on my first ride, I didn't feel any pain in the padding area. The fabric is sleek and is a better product than other cycling shorts. You can tell the quality by the fact it isn't transparent.FUNCTION:The cycling underwear works well. Compared to other competitors, this is better as it has silicone lined leg bands and use a chamois pad instead of a cheap gel pad. Furthermore, it uses a much higher quality fabric. This is much better than the similar Xcellent cycling underwear. It also wicks well, which is why it is better than normal underwear for cycling. Also, please note that this is meant to be worn underneath shorts or pants.This is good for the price, for all cyclists. It mimics the padding and fabric of higher quality cycling shorts. I would even use these for touring as these go under one's clothing.	Raj V	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A2XD1NQVT6E5VP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/08/25

B00OPZJDO0	Good initial quality but poor design is uncomfortable in actual use	I purchased these to to wear under street clothes for bike commuting. I do a lot of recreational cycling and typically wear bike shorts or a cycling bib for longer distance rides, but was looking for something a bit more inconspicuous for shorter distance commutes. I was pleasantly surprised by the initial quality, especially given the price. The fabric quality and padding is good. My complaint is that the legs do not have a strong elastic band at the bottom and immediately ride up my thighs while riding. This causes all of the leg fabric on the shorts to bunch up in the crotch region, making these very uncomfortable for biking. A good pair of bike shorts will have a wide elastic band at the bottom of the leg; generally with a rubberized backing, to keep them from riding up your legs. That is what this pair of shorts needs. You are better off buying a pair of normal spandex biking shorts to wear under other clothes. These are very uncomfortable in actual use. I do think the padding is very good and I may try to sew these into another pair of shorts.

B00OPZJDO0	Uncomfortable, bad design	I bought my first pair couple of years back, then bought another 2 recently.I hate to say it, but these turned out to be very bad.First off, there is a significant difference in design between my first and second pairs. The new design includes ribbing around the leg. That ribbing so ridiculously tight.The padding design has changes as well. It is now too big and tends to rub uncomfortably around the wrong areas, giving sores.Additionally, the pants are too short at the legs and they tend to curl up.Overall, I am totally unhappy with these and off to buy one, hopefully a bit longer, and definitely not shipped direct from China.

B00OPZJDO0	but I am so glad I did	I was a little nervous to purchase the shorts because of some of the reviews, but I am so glad I did.  The shorts have been great for me.  The legs have a nice elastic band that grips comfortably to your leg and keeps the shorts from riding up.  I have used the shorts for mountain trail riding. Before the shorts I would be incredibly sore for at least a week after a ride, but now with the shorts I find no pain at all.  It does feel like I am wearing an adult diaper at times but it is all worth it.	Matthew M.

B00OPZJDO0	Nice padded short liners for biking	I purchased these for my son who does rides of about 2-3 hours four or five times a week.  He was really resistant to bike shorts as he thought they'd feel funny and he also thought they looked funny.  I had a pair similar to these that are worn underneath your shorts.  Once he realized he couldn't tell when I was or wasn't wearing the liner, he was game to get a pair of his own.  He was impressed that these cycle shorts actually provided real relief on his ride.  He thought he was a little more sweaty than usual, but I pointed out his shirt was equally sweaty, so I don't think it was the shorts.  They've made their way into the washing machine a number of times and have come out looking good -- no shrinking or pulling on the fabric.  He's pleased with these and now won't go for a long ride without them!	JSR	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A1MV0REL08J5EN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/06/28

B00OPZJDO0	Well made but uncomfortable adult diaper for cyclists	Good overall but the padding is much too thick and unnecessarily complex in ergonomic shape. The thick padding absorbs and holds too much perspiration and aggravates chafing, especially along the sides between the thighs and scrotum. The padding may be comfortable for some riders with hard saddles, and might be better in cooler weather. But it's wrong for me with a padded saddle this summer, with heat and humidity combining for felt temperature in the 90s-100s F. I'll save them for the winter and try again. Meanwhile I've bought some more comfortable AeroTech Pro cycling shorts.On the plus side, the shorts fit well, the workmanship appears very good for the money, the thigh grippers hold without discomfort or chafing, and the poly/nylon/Spandex shorts material breathes and wicks moisture well.With thinner padding, without the unnecessarily complicated ergonomic shapes, these would rate a 4 out of 5 stars.

Padded bike shorts is great and quality not like the very thin knock offs. The fit is perfect! Snug and conforms to body like it should.  It's very easy to put on too. It has an excellent fitment and very comfortable. What I like most is the comfort of riding far without feeling any discomfort on the rear.  So far so good no discolor of the material. Not bad for the price and will definitely recommend this to anyone on a budget. It does exactly what it should.  Overall, I can say that I’m happy using this product and can recommend this to anyone.  It’s a definite buy in my book.

B00OPZJDO0	A little too short for me.	I must say that these shorts run on the small side, also they are shorter than I was hoping for. Nice padding though.Update: Since the posting of my initial review Baleaf reached out to me apologizing for my dissatisfaction with the sizing of their product. They quickly refunded me half of the cost of the shorts. The padding of these shorts are great so I asked them if the could recommend another product that will better suit my needs and Baleaf quickly responded with several options. I placed another order with them using one of their suggestions also because of their professionalism and willingness to quickly address my initial problem. For that I will raise them one star and once I receive my new shipment and am happy with their suggestion I will update my review further.

B00OPZJDO0	Great product and great price	My husband doesn't ride as often as I do, usually only family rides on the weekend of anywhere from 10-20+ miles. He was really hurting and walking bow-legged after some of the rides, but wouldn't agree to a pair of biking shorts. He thought you could only have the tight/pro style. I found these Baleaf padded "undershorts" and decided to order for him. He LOVES them. Just wears them underneath his normal shorts and you can't tell you have them on, and he is not complaining of being uncomfortable on rides. Great product and great price!

B00OPZJDO0	They were so comfortable and easy to wash and fit just right	My husband and I had to rely on our bikes for transportation for 4 months while saving up for a car, and when I decided to get a new cushioned seat for my bike for extra comfort, my husband decided to invest in some padded biking shorts. After reading extensive reviews on Amazon, we chose the Baleaf brand "Baleaf Men's 3D Padded Bicycle Cycling Underwear Shorts". They were so comfortable and easy to wash and fit just right.  My husband is 5'10" and has a 32" inch waist and found that size MEDIUM fit perfectly and he liked that the length is short enough that it does not show under his shorts, nor ride up on him while biking.  He said the shorts add extra comfort "in all the right places" and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys biking for longer periods of time for added comfort. We have found Baleaf to be a trustworthy brand for quality biking shorts and would recommend them to anyone looking for a more comfortable biking experience.

The shorts are inside out in the picture, they actually fit like regular tighter fitting shorts (and are all black on the outside). My favorite thing about these shorts is the delicate yet firm protection they offer the prostate/musket/scrotum region. My first ride with these shorts was a 12 mile ride, in a hybrid bike, and that region had no problems after. Very happy with this purchase. Additionally, an unadvertised perk of these shorts is you can turn them inside out and run around with a baboon butt, girlfriends love it.	Linda S.

B00OPZJDO0	Good shorts for the price	Pros:  Fit as expected, provides paddingCons:  Padding is a little thin, slide down while ridingI bike 30-50 miles a week and my seat was definitely a pain point, so I decided to purchase these padded shorts.  They're definitely not as padded as the picture would lead you to believe.  It does provide a little bit of cushioning, but not much if you're a heavy guy like me.  The fit was true to my normal size, so there was no issue there.I found that these shorts also slide down just a little while riding, so I had to adjust them every lap or so.  It's not a huge deal, but I have other bicycle shorts that have a little of rubber to stop them from sliding.Overall, I think these were a good pair of shorts for the price ... but I have found that it may be worth paying a bit more if you need extra cushion and comfort.

B00OPZJDO0	Not for me.	The material of these padded bicycle shorts was very nice.  They felt comfortable against the skin and provided no irritation or uncomfortable rubbing.  That being said, the padding was insufficient.  The pictures make it appear that the padding is very substantial; however, in person it is not.  I've not seen other brands that have any more padding than these in any stores or online either.  While ridding on even short distance trips the padding provided very little if any additionally comfort because the padding became so compressed or it did not exactly match up with the placement of my sit bones and therefor was not in the correct position to provide support.  This was dependent on how much I shifted on the seat as I rode.  I found that I had to adjust the shorts as I rode to get the padding to where I wanted it.

B00OPZJDO0	Great buy but wash before use unless you want to join the blue man group.	The shorts made my half century rides more endurable.  I was in much better shape after the ride than my friends and the scouts in my troop at the conclusion.  I think they helped an old man keep up and enjoy the ride better than the younger leaders and youth.  The only distraction with the shorts is that the color bleeds out to discolor contacting clothing layers.  I should have sent them though the wash before use.  Overall the improved ride is worth the price of the shorts.  They work as well as other shorts I have purchased just need to wash at least once before use or you may start to look like you belong in the blue man group.

B00OPZJDO0	Decent Pair! Order a size Down for the Perfect fit.	First off, just want to clairfy for some other reviews on here. These are padded underpants/ shorts to go under mountain bike shorts, urban cycling pants, normal shorts, etc. That's why they sit higher on the thigh. Only, thing I recommend is to order a size down so they fit snug. Mine's say a little but I just pull them a tad bit higher. Overall, great pair!

B00OPZJDO0	Comfortable Shorts - Asian sizes	I have used these shorts twice, once under another pair of shorts and once by themselves. They are comfortable and well padded. I do an hour a day, about 12 miles. I am a size 38 pant (although my wife says I push out over my belt a bit. I bought the 2XL based on another comment and they fit perfect. Not too tight, very flexible. light and comfortable. I am not sure how long they would wear being directly on the bicycle seat so will plan to use a pair of light sports shorts over them. I don't see these as standing up to heavy riding but for what I do I believe they will be worth the cost. Very happy with this product.

I saw these highly acclaimed for top 10 or so products for a more comfortable ride on some review site - so I bought these for long motorcycle trips - and they were well worth the $12 bucks!I'm used to riding with these on my mountain bike, so figured they would be just as nice for my Sportster.Even tho these are men's - and I'm a girl - I ordered way up in size than what I needed, they worked GREAT. Well made - noticeably more comfortable ride on my hard factory sportster seat - super comfy - not binding and a plus for adding a layer of warmth on a cool riding day in October in Chicagoland.If you are considering - totally worth the $10!!!	_t0ni_	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A3BVZ2R7XMK8FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/11/13

B00OPZJDO0	These shorts work better than anything else I have tried	I am relatively new to biking and have faced the dreaded sore posterior on my longer rides.  I have tried several different seats but they do not seem to work for me.  These shorts work better than anything else I have tried.  In trying out these shorts for the first time I had to adjust to the feeling of having the padding in my shorts but once you are on the bike it is worth the unusual feeling.  Sized as expected and fit well.  Much cheaper than the options I was looking at with some of the online bike retailers.  I don't know if it is possible but if I could find a pair that felt a little less bulky with the same pain relief they would get 5 stars.

B00OPZJDO0	Great shorts for the price.	Update: After a month and a couple of hundred miles, these shorts are still going fine. I've worn them under regular cargo shorts, and thermal cycling tights as the temps have dropped. The padding has been enough, and they have stood up to being machine washed on delicate after every ride. I wouldn't wear them for a century ride, but if you're wearing liners under non-cycling clothes you're probably not doing a century that day. I would get more, but the thigh grippers are just too tight.Pretty happy with these shorts. I am fairly new to cycling, and have been riding in street clothes until recently. I got these and some Canari G2's at about the same time. These fit about as I expected, maybe a little tight around the thigh gripper, and tiny bit looser than expected everywhere else. I wear a 36" waist jean, and I got the XL. I think the LG would fit perfectly, but my thighs would hate me. The padding is nice, and for my hour/hour and a half rides, it's comparable to the Canaris. I dunno about longer, but I suspect it would do just fine for a few hours.

B00OPZJDO0	Good quality product, but padding doesn't go far enough.	I have to say I was impressed with the quality and make of the product, but as I have discovered after some miles of riding it is definitely designed for an Asian posterior.  The shorts fit as expected, from a waist and length perspective, but when I sit on the saddle the gel padding does not go far enough up my cheeks so my sit bone is well covered, basically my sit bone is half on the edge padding and half on the saddle.  So I would recommend for people with smaller butts, those lithe skinny road bikers, but for the average western mountain biker this doesn't do the job, shame as in all other ways it is good.

Only nit is sometimes getting back onto my seat, the top part of the pad on the butt side catches on the seat nose and pulls my pants down a bit.  I got use to it an I think I'm mounting my seat from a slightly different angle now.  This is because I wear this over my gym shorts, for 2 reasons:  I don't have to wash this as much, and I can put keys, garage door openers in my gym shorts pockets with this over to keep it from falling out.

While they provide appropriate padding, the legs lack an elastic and rubber "band" that holds tight and sticks to the legs to keep them from riding up.

B00OPZJDO0	These will be going in the trash.	I raced XC mountain bikes 10+ years ago and I was looking for a cheaper replacement to my closet of pearl izumi shorts that are starting to show their age and wear out.Now I mostly ride to run errands - ride my 4yo to school and back, grocery store runs, about 1 hour long rides to get minor cardio workouts in - but I still felt some discomfort when just wearing sport shorts.I was looking for something less expensive than ~120 bucks when I spotted these.  I had no idea they made something like this.Major issues:1. Padding in crotch area adds to pressure against perineum when it should help to alleviate it.  With pearl izumi, there is a depression in the center of the crotch not a bulbous padded area.2. Padding in seat is too much.  It feels like diapers.  Especially while walking.3. The legs bunch up into your crotch.  There isn't any sticky substance to prevent them from hiking up while your legs move and within 15 minutes, all the fabric is bunched into your crotch.To compare, I also spent about 2x as much as this product on a pair of pearl izumi men's liner shorts and those worked very well.These will be going in the trash.

B00OPZJDO0	Great budget shorts must have in your inventory.	So the shorts fit extremely well for $10. I believe that for what they are they're excellent. I use them for my daily commute writing which is about 10 miles at the most and they're extremely comfortable for the most part I usually put shorts on top of them and I feel fine. Before I purchase these I was planning and purchased several Pearl Izumi which fit like a glove they are by far the best $30 shorts that I've ever had. The padding on the Pearl Izumi is slightly thinner than the budget ones and I can comfortably ride around 30 to 50 miles with them. The bay leaf shorts are really well for a short commute or if you're just starting to ride road bikes more consistently. If they can only improve the fit of the material that the shorts are made out of these would be phenomenal with that said the family that comes inside with the padding is as good or better than my Pearl Izumi.

B00OPZJDO0	Great Pair of Bicycle Shorts for the Price	After reading reviews that suggested ordering a size up, I did. I am 6'4" and have a waist of 36"-38" and I ordered the XXL to be safe. The fit is good around the waist but the pad seems to be a little too low for my liking. I wish it would sit just a little farther back. I feel like I have to give myself a wedgie to make them fit right. However, once i get the right placement they work pretty well. I would recommend these for 30+ mile bike rides but anything less they will definitely help distribute some of the pressure that causes bruising and pain after riding.Overall, its a great value for the price!

B00OPZJDO0	Very nice inexpensive cycling underware	Ordered one size up, and it fits perfectly. Mine came with thigh silicone grippers, which help the shorts to stay in place. Took me a few rides to adjust to these, which also required adjusting the seat angle. My usual cycling shorts didn't give me any discomfort with the I experienced numbness after about 5 miles of riding in the beginning, but they seem to be working fine now. Paid $10 for mine, came back to order another pair, but the price is up to $15. Will wait a few days for the price to drop down, which, according to tracking sites, it does frequently.

B00OPZJDO0	Great value. Highly recommend.	Decided to get back into bike riding to change up my running routine especially in the summer heat of Florida. I found that the cooling breeze of riding 12 to 15 mph allowed me to exercise longer without the feeling of imminent heat stroke. Like most riders, I struggled with seat discomfort and the tingly numbness associated with a standard seat. I decided to purchase a Hobson Easy Seat 2 which greatly reduced sit bone pain and helped extend my riding time well past on hour. I debated whether or not padded biking undergarments would help with a split seat, but for such a low price, I decided to try a pair of these. Based on other reviews, I bought a size larger than what I normally wear, and they fit great. I am 6'3",250 lbs and wear an XL, so I bought these in size XXL. I have tree trunks for legs, so the additional space in the larger size was needed in the thighs. When you first put them on, the extra padding in the crotch area feels very weird and I would not recommend walking around in them. However, once you get on the bike and get situated in a good position, these shorts allow you to go a very long time without experiencing that uncomfortable sit bone pain. I would highly recommend these to anyone who likes to ride their bike but finds themselves cutting their time short because of numbness. I have washed these twice now and they seem to be holding up well. I plan on purchasing more of these in the future.

B00OPZJDO0	Excellent riding shorts.	I was in the market for some riding pants. I purchased 1  of these and 1 of the Pearl izumi(3x the cost) to compare, this was my result.First impression: I noticed the Pearls are slightly longer in the leg, and the seams and linings look as though they may have more substance to them than the Baleafs. Putting them on- lets face it, these things feel weird when you aren't on your bike- but the Baleaf's seems to have noticeably softer materials inside, and even after a couple of washes, the Pearls seemed itchy at times. From what I can tell the Baleaf's also have thicker padding, which is nice if you have Hank Hill posterior syndrome like me.Conclusion after a few rides(20-30mi): The Baleaf take it HANDS DOWN. They are my favorite, for fit and comfort, and being as they are a third of the cost to the izumi's it was no question for me to quickly pick up 2 more pair to have on hand.I purchased large for both, I am 5'11 170 pretty average frame, they both fit well and as expected.

B00OPZJDO0	Fantastic Product	When you first put these on, it's one strange feeling. I did a 24 mile trail ride and never had to stand up. These really work well and once situated you won't even notice you're wearing them. Longer rides you'll still feel fine, but once in awhile you'll need to readjust yourself.

I have rather large thighs with my tree trunk legs, and the elastics around the legs are somewhat uncomfortable after a long period of time. It would be nice if this product came in a larger size for the legs since the waist fits well, just not the legs, but only 1 star for this. The product works well though and makes for a comfortable bike ride. Initially the cushioning was not providing good cushion but I had used a new seat as well and once I adjusted the seat to the correct position the shorts did their job beautifully.Overall, a good purchase and very comfortable.

B00OPZJDO0	Back in the saddle again	What a difference these make.  They felt weird when I first put them on because you've got this beefy pad against your unmentionable areas.  But once in the saddle its all comfort.  Since I have a muscular build (24" mid thigh), I ordered these in XXL.  XXL was not loose but it wasn't as snug as I expected, in particular in the hip flexor area.  I reordered two more in XL and they fit great.  At the thigh there is a kind of grippy rubber/silicon material that prevents the leg from riding up.Before I got these, I could ride maybe 6 miles and it was time to get off the bike.  Now it's no longer a limiting factor.	EricInTX	Color: Black|Size: XX-Large	B00CWVPCLM	/gp/pdp/profile/AZLZX43RCAI6B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/08/25

B00OPZJDO0	Save your BUTT.	I have to admit I was a little worried about the size since I read they ran small so I ordered the XXXL.  I wear a XL in regular men's underwear and these are still pretty tight.  Other than the size they will save your butt.  I could ride a bike all day long if it weren't for the wear and tear the bike seat puts on my butt.  These make a huge difference and I recommend them for anyone who enjoys riding a bike for any distance what so ever.

B00OPZJDO0	Shorter in the leg than other shorts = tighter leg fit for me	I have bigger biking thighs and found the XL to be a tighter than other brands of shorts I have in the same size. These shorts are shorter than the Pearl Izumi shorts I buy at Performance, so the tightness in the legs is probably due to the fact they are on the thickest part of the thigh. I will use these shorts, but will probably not buy another pair in the future.	Spenn	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B00CWVPAU0	/gp/pdp/profile/A1P3VXTAZSHUIP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2015/08/21

B00OPZJDO0	No more numb... uh... areas.	Great value!  I Ride 8 to 10 miles a day, 5 or 6 days a week.  This was a significant improvement over the gel pad seat cover I've been using.  I have continued to use the seat pad but my comfort level is much better with these giving added padding.  I found that I'm not having to re-adjust my seating position every few minutes, and certain (ahem) areas don't go numb any more.  Fits well.  Be sure to follow the size guide in the Product Description.  I have a 42" waist and the 3XL fits perfectly.  I have not had any problem with the legs riding up.  The tacky hem in the legs keeps them in place well.  Just make sure and wear them with the black side out to have the tacky side of the leg hem face inward and to avoid that "baboon butt" look ;-)	Spearhead Video	Color: Black|Size: XXX-Large	B00CWVPDKM	/gp/pdp/profile/A326BYX5RT90PY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/08/19

B00OPZJDO0	I came across these shorts and like many, I was enticed by the low price	I do a lot of cycling and was interested in investing in another pair of padded shorts. After doing some shopping, I came across these shorts and like many, I was enticed by the low price. After reading a number of reviews, I decided to risk it, purchase these shorts and hope that I had found a bargain. Unfortunately, these have to be one of the most uncomfortable shorts I have ever worn. Not only do they seem to run on the large size, it feels exactly like you are wearing a diaper. I managed to endure these shorts for one 10 mile ride and have never worn them since.As other reviewers have mentioned, the stock photo is only trying to illustrate the padding and the outside of these shorts do not look blue.My advice is to avoid Baleaf Men's 3D Padded Coolmax Bicycle Cycling Shorts. Spend $20 more and get the Pearl Izumi Men's Liner Shorts.	Erik W	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/ANRBT3KD434JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	35	1	2015/08/18

B00OPZJDO0	Meh, just okay.	Fit is okay and as expected.  I ordered large, 6'2",  size 34/34, about 195 and they fit fine.  However, these are not what I would call serious cycling shorts.  For short rides in the park or similar they're alright.  They provide padding but that's about it.  The padding is pretty generic and the leg length is fairly short so it offers no quad compression of any consequence.  If you want to ride with your hiking or cargo shorts then these are fine but again, not for serious road biking in my opinion.  Cheap alternative to just get some padding in your seat and if that is the goal they will work fine.

B00OPZJDO0	Not bad	I'd give these 3.5 stars. Everything is as described, I just expected a little more. The padding isn't great, just thin foam. I would have liked more of a gel padding. The thinnest part of the padding is in between your legs, which I dunno about you guys on road bikes, but that's where I need more. Makes me feel a bit like a woman wearing an overnight pad. I'm still buying a new saddle so if you were getting these in hopes of not buying one maybe it will work for you but me not so much.

B00OPZJDO0	kind of feel like what I assume wearing a diaper feels like yet ...	Bought to wear on longer motorcycle trips. These are way cheaper than the Motoskivees, kind of feel like what I assume wearing a diaper feels like yet I was amazed at how much they helped. I usually start squirming in the seat after about 75 miles (my motorcycle seat leaves a lot to be desired) Took a 125 mile ride to try these out and felt I could have kept going. Don't know that I'd wear them for day trips as I don't really need them for that, but when I go overnight and have a 500+ mile day, I'll be wearing them. Well worth 15 bucks.

B00OPZJDO0	Great product a must have.	I have a terrible bike saddle and was barely able to go out a mile or two before I was in so much pain that I hated the ride. Got these padded cycling briefs and I was able to go out and enjoy my ride so much more. I was able to go so much further and without much pain. Also these are briefs and can fit under any pair of pants including jeans. I have ordered a new saddle and can only imagine being able to go out as far as I want and without pain.Well worth the money.I will buy another pair.I did order a medium when I usually go with a large but I wanted them to be snug, they fit perfect.I am a 56yrs 192lbs 6'2" medium built male that has not been on a bike in 10 years and am grateful for this technology.

B00OPZJDO0	Good product, but too large for my size	This product is a men's large. I am a size 10 woman. Reviews said to order a size up. If I pull it up high it should stay in place underneath my riding leggings with a huge bulgy gap of air space in the seat area. I am going to ask to return it as it doesn't fit well. It does have quite ample gel padding and looks like it will definitely do the job of cushioning my ride. The black fabric is smooth, on the thin, flimsy side but should last for what it is worth. There is no compression factor in the fabric. It would be a relaxed fit on most wearers. The elastic looks well sewn and decent with rubber grip surface inside so it won't ride up. The seams are well reenforced. I would give 4 stars if the fit were right for me. I could try a medium but I am afraid that the leg elastic will be too tight, as that is the only place where the size L fits comfortably. Delivery was fast, the shorts arrived in only 2 days.	M.

B00OPZJDO0	Good value, still having soreness?	Good value, fits as expected.  It arrived within a few days, earlier than expected.  They definitely have made the 15-20 mile rides much less uncomfortable (first gel shorts I've used).  Per my sister (who is an avid cyclist) if you continue to have soreness consider having your seat measured at a good cycle shop.  Apparently the width of your sit bones, and size and shape of the saddle make a large difference in comfort. I only use cycling as one of the sports I enjoy so I have very little expertise.

B00OPZJDO0	Bum bliss	Been riding on these for 450 miles in the last week. About 6-8 hour days. Very good stuff.. no chafe whatsoever.

B00OPZJDO0	Okay for the price, if the padding works for you	Cycling shorts need to fit both the rider’s body type and position on the bike, and these shorts don’t really work for me on either score.  The tall waist band and the leg openings are very comfortable, unlike some other cycling shorts I've tried.  But the padding is placed too high and too far back to provide much support on the sitz bones or toward the front of the saddle.  It’s too bad, because I really wanted to like these shorts more than I do.  For the price, though, they're worth ordering a pair to see if they fit you better than they fit me.  They do run somewhat small, so it's probably wise to order one size larger than usual.	M.

B00OPZJDO0	Ahhhhhhhh	Let's face it these are to protect your butt.  So far it appears that they are working fine.  The bones and neighboring soft tissue and internal organ for which my butt fails to provide ample shock absorption on a long bicycle ride seem well protected by these shorts.  Washed a couple times and they show no sign of wear or damage.  After a 20 mile ride I do not feel the need to see a proctologist, urologist or any "gist" for that matter.  That is a good thing when you are 69 years old.	Salguod	Color: Black|Size: XX-Large	B00CWVPCLM	/gp/pdp/profile/ARDF8L011DINT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/06/16

I wash these every time I ride and they are holding up well and keeping their shape. I do not dry these in a dryer I just hang them up and a few hours later they are dry. I wish the leg length was a bit longer I think it would make them that more comfortable.

B00OPZJDO0	Perfect for those not wanting to dive headfirst into full bike kits, or spend $75 on a pear of Pearl Izumi's	Wow, I can't believe these are $15. I took them on a 60 miler shortly after receiving them, and also on an 11-mile trail ride. The padding is awesome, especially for the price. I bought a pair of larges (size 32 waist) on the recommendation of other reviews, and they fit well. My only complaint is that the leg holes are too small and dig into my thighs, though mine are bigger than most cyclists'. These are perfect for someone that doesn't want to jump full on into a cycling kit or spend serious cash on name-brand cycling shorts.

B00OPZJDO0	Get them	These are great. I don't like bicycle shorts, and these give me the option to where regular clothes while riding. I recently did a two day training course of 25 miles each day. These shorts made it so I no trouble climbing back on the bike the next day. I am ordering more pairs soon. I recomend that if you want the benifits of bicycle shorts with the ability to wear street clothes, get these shorts. The padding will feel strange when you are off the bike, but these shorts are designed for riding. I am sure that astronauts feel strange in their space suits when not in space. Anyway, gets these shorts.	Jonathan Dillard	Color: Black|Size: XX-Large	B00CWVPCLM	/gp/pdp/profile/A1BIA3BG57T1RT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/06/04
B00OPZJDO0	Thick Cushy Pad But Less Than Perfect Comfort	The chamois itself is super-cushy, and gives lots of padding.  Thumbs-up there.  Though being foam and not gel, I suspect the thickness will soon diminish.  Comfy while riding, but not so much just walking around. Chamois is a little stiff, and tends to "float" slightly away from your crotch unless you really pull 'em up tight.  So a slightly odd sensation.  I know the fabric of the briefs claims to be Coolmax, but it doesn't seem to be all that breathable.  I'm afraid these will be too hot once deep into Texas summer.  I may just cut out the chamois/pad and sew it into a pair of meshy boxer-briefs.  Which at this amazingly low price-point, does not seem that unreasonable.

B00OPZJDO0	My @$$ Thanks You Baleaf	I know that ultimately our rear ends need to adapt to riding on bikes, but this is a great wait to ease into the transition. I spin several miles a week and my tailbone had a hard time adjusting. After this purchase all pain is non existent. For that I am grateful.The material is bittersweet. The padding seems solidly put together but the "spandex" material is very flimsy. I'll be surprised if these make it through a dozen washes. Of course, I'm hand washing these, and air drying to try and prolong the life as much as possible.I'm happy with this purchase overall. The reason for the 5 stars is the cost and comfort.

B00OPZJDO0	Baleaf vs. Ohuhu vs. Xcellent Global	It was difficult for me to tell which was “best” based on the descriptions and reviews so I decided to order one each of the Ohuhu, Xcellent Global and Baleaf to decide for myself.Overall, all three do a nice job of providing padding where needed, help keep me dry (and thus prevent chafing) “down there,” dry quickly, are comfortable, and appear to be wearing well.  After I have ridden, and then gotten off the bike, none of them have that “full diaper” feel when I walk around.  None of them have a significant “con” though there are some differences which might sway your decision as a “pro.”  Do note that the sizing varies among the three…I am 5’8” with a 41” waist and 39” hips.  Based on comments, I ordered the XXL size for Xcellent and Baleaf and the XL for Ohuhu.Waist size (no stretch, full stretch): Baleaf (XXL) 32” (50” full stretch); Ohuhu (XL) and Xcellent (XXL) 28” (48” full stretch).Inseam – 2” Ohuhu, 3” Baleaf, 4” XcellentThe pad is very similar on the Ohuhu and Baleaf.  Slightly different on the Xcellent, but all three are comparable and adequate.Differences:Ohuhu has a more open weave in the fabric – might offer slightly better cooling but haven’t had any heat issues with the other pairs.Baleaf – grippy elastic at bottom of legs – may help keep the legs from creeping up, though haven’t found it to be a problem on the other two pairs.

B00OPZJDO0	Makes all the difference.	I am a beginning cyclist ... at it for just a coupke of weeks now.  These "shorts' -- pretty sure they were intended to be underwear -- certainly took the saddle sore factor away completely.  That is say, I am now able to ride until my legs give out as opposed to when my delicate areas get unbearably sore.  The size is a bit snug, but they're still reasonably comfortable.  The padding is perfect, doing the job, without being too bulky.  I ride wearing cargo shorts and they are not at all noticeable underneath if I stop to walk around.  I will probably order additional pairs in a bigger size.	Darrin Snider	Color: Black|Size: XX-Large	B00CWVPCLM	/gp/pdp/profile/A33PZPS7NFLWKR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2015/05/14

This is fine for a back up / forgot to wash my other "real" bike shorts, but don't bugs these expecting anything great. They are too big at waist and leg, the waist rolls down, the legs roll up, and they just don't stay in place well. if you need a cheapo pair to throw in a gym bag, go for it.

B00OPZJDO0	Best Padded Shorts I've Tried So Far	With only one ride under my belt with these padded "under" shorts...I can say I'm happier with these than another type I've tried.  I bought 2 pairs of "exterior" shorts that are padded  that are not nearly as padded or comfortable.  Wearing those shorts also meant taking up room in my hydration pack for another pair of shorts for when I get to work.  These Baleaf shorts solve both problems.  They have more padding and are generally more comfortable to wear, and since I wear my boxers, then the Baleafs, then my regular shorts...when I get to work I can just take the Baleafs off and stash em in a drawer without having a whole other extra pair of shorts to cart around.  Unless I find a pair of padded under shorts that work better, I plan to buy several more pairs of these and then I probably won't wear the other ones much if at all.  As far as sizing with these...to me they seem to run just a bit small.  I typically wear a 32"-34" waist depending on how the pants/shorts/jeans/whatever are "cut"...got these in a Large and they're pretty snug.  Not uncomfortably so but if I gained a couple pounds I would have to move up to an XL.  These seem to be cut like a small Large if that makes any sense.  As long as they hold up through a good number of rides then I think these will be a good value that I'll order more of.

B00OPZJDO0	Good For A "Cushy" Ride!	I just wore these for the first time, and they significantly improved my comfort during a 32 mile bike ride.  I agree with other reviewers that the sizes on these may run small, so I ordered one size larger than I would normally wear - perfect.  My only complaint is that they may have been a bit tight in the crotch, but they were still a significant improvement over no padding at all.  I would purchase again.  However, be aware that these can only be washed in cold water (no bleach), and must be line dried.	J.

B00OPZJDO0	Works good, comfort okay.	Provides some relief on long trips but not quite as much as I was expecting. The legs are very tight and I had lines dug into my thighs after wearing them. It keeps them from riding up but left me somewhat uncomfortable. It feels like you are wearing a full diaper when walking around but feels natural and comfortable while riding. It wears under shorts without any problem and my wife said that they aren't very noticeable. Some chaffing did occur after a 13 mile ride but my rear-end did not hurt as much as it usually does with my hard seat. I ordered it the same size as I do my underwear and the fit was fine.	Nate P.

B00OPZJDO0	OK, but not the Best Value	The fit on these seemed to be a little bit curious.  The material in the waist is thin and unsubstantial, and feels loose.  The legs are a little bit tighter, (and my legs are not nearly as big as most cyclist).  The result is they feel like the are going to fall down quite a bit, are only being held up by the legs, and could be improved if they made the waist band a little more substantial.The padding is adequate if not great, and I definitely felt a notable improvement over riding in bare shorts. I bought 2 of these and if they hold up over a few washes I could see myself buying another pair or two.Update:  I bought a pair of Canari padded liners, and they are way better for roughly the same price.

B00OPZJDO0	Saved my ass....	Where to start.  I'll preface to say I'm new to cycling.  I recently purchased a road bike and very motivated to start my cycling fitness routine.  My first reality check was the discomfort to my backside.  Even in cycling shorts, my ass gave out long before my legs did.  I found a gel seat cover in the garage from one of my wife's old bike and put it on the seat for some extra padding.  This only seemed to make things worse and I could barely walk after a 9 mile ride.  My butt felt like it had been beaten and bruised.  I started looking at $100+ seats to get away from this pain and stumbled across this cycling "underwear" and decided I'd give it a shot.  It was a good price so low risk right?  Most of the reviews read that they ran small.  I'm a 36 waist and, reading the reviews, that tracked to an XL.  I ordered two pairs of the XLs which I received today.  I tried them on right away, my derrier still sore from the weekend beating it took.  First impression, they fit loosely.  Much looser than the compression cycling shorts I had become accustomed to.  If you've ever held up a pair of "granny panties" that's what they looked and felt like other than the thick padding.  They fit loose and made me question my decision to go with the XL.  In hindsight, I should have just gone with an XL and an L and see where I landed.  Again, these are billed as "cycling underwear" so I need some shorts to go over them.  They were loose fitting and I was missing the compression fit of cycling shorts.  Since I was still sore, I said "what the hell" and put the cycling shorts on over the "cycling underwear" - double padding.  It didn't feel overly bulky so I decided to go with it.  I got rid of the gel seat and back to the stock seat that came with my Cannondale.  It was a good ride and I exceeded my max on distance at 13.3 miles.  Tired but not overly sore in the butt like I was on my last ride.  I can work with this and I'm no longer in a rush to spend every nickel I can muster on a high end bike seat that may or may not make a difference.  Give this a try and I hope you have as good a luck as I did with these padded "granny panties".

B00OPZJDO0	Worked excellently for my 2-day 100 mile bike ride.	I came back to give this product 5 stars.  These shorts protected my sit-bones even though I sit in a forward-leaning, road bike-style position when I ride.  I just completed a 2-day, 8.5 hour long, 100 mile bike ride yesterday and had no saddle soreness. These shorts WORK.  It turns out that the trick for me was to pull the waistband of these shorts up as high as I could without hurting myself. Once I did that, I didn't need to readjust or anything along the ride.  My sitbones were fine the night I finished the 100 miles, and today they feel like I was never on a bike to begin with.My original review, below:I have a lean, athletic build, and I wear a 32-33 waist in jeans.  The large was too big, so I returned it for a medium which fit much better, but still made me feel like I was wearing a diaper. I attribute the diaper feeling to the bulky cushioning in the shorts.  I hear that's how a lot of padded shorts feel, so I didn't take off any stars for that.  Just thought you should be warned.The shorts have ample cushion for your butt, that's for sure. And If you ride sitting in a fairly vertical or even reclined position, then I have no doubt that these cushions will greatly improve your comfort on long rides because the padding is situated to protect the parts of your "sit bones" that will contact the bike saddle when riding in that vertical or reclined position.  But I ride in a road bike-like setup, with my seat high, and my torso leaning forward. The part of my body that makes contact with my bike saddle are the extreme anterior of my "sit bones."  These shorts do not have cushion in that area to pad against that part of my sit bones that are in contact most while leaning forward in that racing position.  This is because the cushions in these shorts are placed in the bottom of the shorts like a ladies menstrual pad (Not trying to be gross, but that's exactly how the pads are situated and shaped in the shorts) and the cushions get narrow between your legs - too narrow to protect my sitbones when I am biking in my racing position.Overall: they seem to be very acceptable for bike seat setups that keep the rider in a more vertical or reclined position, not for forward-leaning setups.

B00OPZJDO0	Game changer and a bargain	For fifteen bucks with free two day shipping, you can't go wrong with these. Local bike shops sell this kind of thing for about $35.  I would say they make riding on a small bike saddle 50% better or more.  More padding than I thought they would have compared to others I have purchased for the same price.  Yes, I agree with others, get a size larger than the sizing chart indicates.  For example, the sizing chart says I need a large but I got the XL and it is perfect.  I can't speak to longevity as I have only used them twice now.	Rowland	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B00CWVPAU0	/gp/pdp/profile/A342XAA3YXGKT9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/04/08

Also don't need so much  padding EVERYWHERE...  - These are unisex so that might explain the extra padding everywhereWaste band fits well but they still seem to be lacking in good fit overall.

B00OPZJDO0	Still Had A Sore Bum After These	I ordered a small and the shorts were a tad bit small for me. I have 23" thighs, and the shorts make little muffin-tops at the top of my thigh. They aren't uncomfortable though, so I'm sure I can trim the fat on my legs to have them look more normal (that just means I get to bike more, yay!!). I can say I didn't have problems with the shorts riding up, as other reviewers mentioned. Most likely because my fat was blocking them, but hey. Win some, lose some I guess.Also, I'd like to mention that I am female. I bought these shorts because they were cheaper than the women's cycling shorts. Needless to say, they did not give me padding where I needed it (should have seen that one coming...). I'm sure the shorts do the job for the men, but I would not recommend for the ladies. Don't be cheap like me! Just go ahead and buy the more expensive women's shorts.In general, the padding of the shorts did not help my booty very much. I guess my butt is a bit larger than the shorts expected, so the padding didn't really cover much (my tush is a lovely 40"). I'm not sure if my padding issue is because I'm female, but my butt was still sore after a 15-mi ride. If you've got a larger tush, I would probably go for shorts with wider padding in the back. These shorts probably won't do it for you.	Leah	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/A1ETUBQQ8NFF0N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2015/02/22

My crotch just plain hurt after a 5 min. ride. I was limiting myself to 7.5 min sprints and trying to ride 5-6 times a day.  I do not like the tight shorts they sell. As soon as I saw these I decided to try them.  I put them over my regular underwear and remove them after each ride. I have now stretched my ride to 15 mins and hope to ride 4 times/day.  There is a lot of wind where I ride and it is now the limiting factor.  At this point it is hard to say how long they will last and how they will wash but for 15 bucks they are worth a try.

B00OPZJDO0	Product quality has deteriorated	Purchased this product a second time, as the first round it was an excellent quality product, But the second time I purchased this, I did not get the same quality product I was hoping for and what I got the first time. The waist elastic is very poor quality, the fabric itself is very poor quality, however the only part of the product that is actually good is the padding itself, and only the padding material and quality remains the same good quality as the first round I purchased this. Not sure if Baleaf decided to only concentrate on maintaining the quality of just the padding and forgot about the rest of the fabric, which has resulted in a poor fitting cycling shorts with good padding :(	RX	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A35BD6X69H4LUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	2	2015/01/21

B00OPZJDO0	Sizing  way off - much smaller than advertized.	The pants are good quality but the sizing is all wrong - I bought a size larger than I normally buy and I can barely get them on. The sizing is way off - almost as if these are childrens bike shorts. I would say that 3X was equal to maybe a L but for someone who had a very short distance between the waist and crotch.. So as much as it pains me to have to pay retail prices - these seem to be something that you have to try on and then purchase. It might alos expain why the bicycle shorts you see in stores are so much more expensive....they are sized to fit the USA market.

I have even ridden my bike in 14 oz. canvas Carhart work pants without worrying about the four layer seam in the crotch of the pants blistering my inseam intersection.If they hold up to regular use I will buy more.

B00OPZJDO0	Great bike shorts for the price!!	I bought 2 of these for me and my son, who's only 9 years old. I bought the XXL and got an XLfor him. They fit us great, and I seem to want to ride longer, as my arse doesn't hurt as much. And I hear no complaints from my son when we ride 8 miles together.I've washed them a few times, and the seem to hold up just fine so far. These are a lot cheaper than what you'll find at any bike or sporting store, and seem to have more padding. Defiantly worth the money.

B00OPZJDO0	It saved my butt	I bought this for a spin class I've been going to twice a week. Love the class, hate the seats. These completely solved that problem. Of course walking around in them it feels, and I assume looks, like you just soiled yourself. So I wear them from the locker room to the bike room and back. If I want to work out afterwards I take them off first. The do the most important thing though, which is making the seat bearable for the hour long sessions. To the point where my performance over the last few months have really increased. Its a simple, cheap and effective upgrade for those who don't have bottoms that tolerate bike seats well.	J. W.

Did just over 11 miles in them today and they are WONDERFUL!!!!  These things are a life (and BUTT) saver!!  Still get a small amount of discomfort, but the seat is just uncomfortable-no matter what you do, it will always be a small, narrow, hard seat. The pads in the shorts are all in the right places and it made the ride much more bearable.  Would highly recommend!!!

These are very comfortable and hold up amazing through washing. I purchased this pair as I lost weight. My waist size has ranged from 28 to 34 currently 28.The medium fit me perfect and and some room left to go up to at least 33 or 34. I suggest going smaller than you think otherwise the padded area isn't snug and will slide around. No more chafing on long hot 3 day rides. Highly recommend.

B00OPZJDO0	Great price and no numbness after rides	I was skeptical when I saw the large bumps on these, but after two rides at about 15 miles each I wasn't numb at all and these work really well. I prefer them over the more expensive padded shorts I have that cost me $40 or $50 a pair and leave me numb after the same ride. And you cannot beat the price.I wear a 36" waist size in pants and the XL in these are a little snug around the legs. But the XL is not uncomfortable at all and if you like a snug fit this is the way to go. If you like a looser fit get the XXL.

B00OPZJDO0	Fits perfect for my size	I have already used this product for 2 days already on the exercise bike I use at the gym. First of all i am a size 36 in pants so i ordered the Large. Fits perfect for my size.You have to get used to the padding it brings while you are wearing it. It almost feels like you have something stuck between your legs towards your butt part but like i said. You have to get used to it and of course wear it under your regular workout shorts. I already wear them under my spandex work out shorts and then another pair of loose shorts over that so its cool. The ride on the bike was very comfortable with the extra padding which it helped very much but the only big problem I have twice already is when i am riding; i guess because of the extra padding; it pushes you forward from the bike seat while you are biking and every 5 minutes i am always adjusting myself on the seat to sit upright and its really a pain because i speed bike the majority of the time i am on it and i dont have the time to be readjusting myself straight up on it. This is my opinion and I hope it helps.....Thanks	C.C.	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A25FDSTIHHAFKX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2014/10/27

The legs are short and the elastic around the thigh doesn't prevent the shorts from riding up uncomfortably. The padding is very thick, more than is necessary. The pad protrudes out of the back and even though i was wearing a shell over these liners, the pad still tended to snag on the nose of the seat. Not really worth it. I'd rather spend $40 on a quality liner.	Mark D.	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A3TP3OU1FNLUWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	2	2014/10/26

B00OPZJDO0	He is much happier - definite much more comfort in the seat area ...	Bought these to replace the XL I had bought earlier for my husband - he is not your typically cyclist he started riding to get in shape since his past athletic injuries are coming through and he can no longer run.  His waist size is 42 and he has bigger athletic build not skinny legs.  He wanted to be able to wear his khaki cargo shorts while riding not the bike shorts he sees other guys wear. So I bought the XL to go under his shorts but XL was a little too tight on him when he was riding, so just purchased the XXL and they are more roomy for him in the legs and seat area.  He is much happier - definite much more comfort in the seat area when riding.  If  underwear size is XL you should buy XXL for comfort.	skiermom	Color: Black|Size: XX-Large	B00CWVPCLM	/gp/pdp/profile/A3S54M7RV3GR67/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2014/10/22

B00OPZJDO0	Great Padding, Mind the Sizing Chart	Fit great, although by the chart on the product site I should have gotten an XXL.  I got an XL and I think they fit just fine.  The padding is as good as any bike shorts I have ever worn, but not noticeably better.  But they provide the level of support I've been used to, and it's great that I can now wear regular shorts with these underneath while spinning.

B00OPZJDO0	Recommended for larger bikers!	I really like these.  I was having trouble with my underside even after switching to a center recessed seat and some friends suggested a pair of these.  At first, I thought the idea was crazy but now I wouldn't ride without them.  I'm somewhat heavy set and I have been using them for nearly a year.  I ordered another pair recently, but I think my first pair is still good to continue using.  They have been washed at least 4x a week too and accidentally dried in the dryer a few times (label says to air dry).  They seem quite robust and go to extremes to protect my bottom.  I have the XL size.  At first, I thought they might have been a bit too tight and I was about to return them, but I think they are supposed to have some tightness so that they hug the sensitive area so I will continue sticking with this size.  It won't take long to get used to them especially after you see how well they help!  Recommended!

B00OPZJDO0	Good price, not a great design.	They are OK. The main problem I have with these shorts is that the padding is narrowly bunched in the center. So when you get on the saddle, they tend to bunch up into your crotch. They fit OK, and they are comfortable enough to use. I'd acutally like the padding to be a bit less or at least spread away from the center of the crotch.	Brian J.

B00OPZJDO0	Now We Are Ready to Ride!!	These shorts greatly improved mine and my husbands bicycle outings. The padding is thick enough to alleviate the discomfort associated with long bike rides. The only reason that we didn't give this five stars is due to the style of short--it fits more like a running pair of shorts (very, very short); however, my husband easily slides a pair of basketball shorts over the top of them. I was also concerned that it took more than 4 weeks for us to receive the item. In the sellers defense, I receive mail at a Army Post Office and it often takes longer to receive items.  And this was the only seller that would send to us overseas, so we are appreciative.  ,	Lady S	Color: Black|Size: XXX-Large	B00CWVPDKM	/gp/pdp/profile/A1S6AL21Q33KZ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2014/09/09
B00OPZJDO0	Excellent shorts. Great for newbies.	I am new to the padded bike shorts scene, and I have limited experience, but hopefully this review helps someone. I bought a pair of padded underwear from REI for $40+ and I bought these for $15.Ride one, I wore the REI shorts, and they were tight -- VERY TIGHT. I guess that's the point though; riders want tight shorts to keep things in place and prevent rashes or whatever. I did not favor this feeling, and I still don't, but I'm hoping I'll get used to it.Ride two, I wore these Baleaf shorts. They were significantly more comfortable. I wear size 32-34 underwear, and because other reviews indicate these shorts run on the small side (thanks guys!), I bought Large (34-36), which fit perfect! I only rode for 35 miles, but they managed to keep me comfortable the entire time. My favorite thing about these shorts (in contrast to the REI Novaro brand) is the material. This soft material stretches with ease, like a stocking. I do not feel as if my circulation is being cut off.Overall, I highly recommend these shorts. I will likely buy another pair. You cannot beat the price!!	thomas	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A1FL4EU7FTNDPJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2014/09/08

B00OPZJDO0	Great Under Other Shorts	Perfect for  wearing underneath regular shorts when you want to ride somewhere and don't want that "biker shorts" look, but still want some padding. Great padding and very comfortable. I've worn these for rides up to about 20 miles with no discomfort issues. The sizing chart was spot on for me - indicated I should get a medium, and they fit great. Only one small ding - the legs don't have the grippers that some bike shorts have to help keep them from riding up on your legs, and I do get a little of that, but not so much as to create any discomfort. I'm thinking about ordering a second pair, so I can always have a clean pair ready to go.	Kevin S.

B00OPZJDO0	For the price, you can't go wrong!	I purchased these based on the reviews of others.  I've tried other padded cycling shorts in the past and these are much better. The padding is very good, it doesn't alleviate all discomfort on very long rides, but it definitely does help.  I think it would help if the padding went a little further up towards the back it would make more sense since I don't need it in the front.  The picture is showing the shorts inside out, the blue part is on the inside when you wear it, and it has black on the outside.  It does feel a little weird walking around in these, but while riding you get used to them.  I wear shorts over these.I found that the fitment was true to size based on the description. Size: S=28-30" M=31-33" L=34-36" XL=37-39" 2XL=40-42" 3XL=42-44"I'm a 32-34 and I purchased a Large and it fit well. The price is great and I will be picking up a few more.	H.M.

I rotate them under this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CZ20CKY/ref=cfb_at_prodpg  and they are amazingly comfortable.  Even without the padding of the outer shorts, they are perfect for all but the longest rides.  And at $11/pair or so, you can buy several for the cost of name brand shorts.	George D.

B00OPZJDO0	Not a cycling short replacement.	As others have mentioned these are UNDERWEAR and not cycling shorts. You will have to find something else to wear over them. My complaints about these shorts are: they ride up during a short 15 mile ride. Major wedgie by the time I got home.No compression from the thin material. I seem to feel the edges of the padding when riding.These are handy for quick little rides but are not a replacement for real cycling shorts.	D.

B00OPZJDO0	Didn't fit quite right.	I bought the Medium shorts to use on my longer rides (30+miles), but they didn't fit well, so I have only used them once. I wear a 30-32" waist in pants, so I figured the medium would work, as a Small isn't available for purchase. Quite frankly, I felt like I was wearing a bulky diaper. The padding sat in the right spots, but the shorts were baggy and loose in the crotch. Unfortunately, these didn't work for me. Not all, bad though...the material is lightweight and breathable, and the padding seems that it would be sufficient (if the fit is proper).

B00OPZJDO0	Too MUCH Padding	I gave a neutral 3 star rating but overall, I am not happy with these bike shorts.  There is too much padding for me personally.  Otherwise, the price is good and they are of decent quality.  Totally unrelated, but I have since discovered that I do not need padded shorts.  As a tip, padded shorts and big gel seats do not always mean more comfort.  After doing some research, I have found that gel seats and shorts change the pressure points and do not always increase comfort.  After unsuccessfully finding comfortable shorts, I tried riding a bit without them and discovered that I do not need them.  May want to try that first.	xBryMilx	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/ARIO6GBFUBUR7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2014/08/10

B00OPZJDO0	Padded pants migrate upward	Great idea.  The pads are thick enough and properly positioned.  Unfortunately, the legs are too loose and the pants migrate upward by the time I have ridden three or four miles.  By the time I have ridden five miles I have a thick twisted knot of material and padding in my groin area.  I have tried several different styles of over shorts and even the shearest of shorts migrate up with the padded pants. Finally, I gave up and threw the padded pants in the garbage.  There is a reason conventional cycling shorts have thick elastic at the legs……it holds them in place.	Jay D.

B00OPZJDO0	Too much padding?	Let me start off by saying my negative review is not due to poor construction or fit. The two star review says "I don't like them", here's why:I bought these to replace some mtn biking short liners that are worn out. For my taste, the padding is too thick. It gets in the way when sliding behind the saddle on steep descents and just makes me feel disconnected from the bike. The excess padding also makes them feel really warm for summer riding. I like some padding in my bike shorts. I've never complained about too much padding before (I've had dozens of bike shorts).Maybe some people will think that more padding is a good thing, however I will not buy this model again.

B00OPZJDO0	Buy two sizes down if you're going to try these.	I have 23 inch thighs and the M still rode up my legs so these kind of became cycling briefs instead of shorts. The downside to that is that you now have a bunch of material jammed up against your thighs and the seat creating more friction than if you had worn normal underwear. The padding isn't that good either, better than riding without any padding but the extra friction from the legs riding up isn't worth it.	cactus	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/A2UWLIFD3VBKPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	1	2014/07/30

I'm hoping to try wearing them again once I lose a few more pounds.  The padding wasn't adequate enough, in my opinion.

If I needed an "underwear" style short that isolated me from my ride so thoroughly that I couldn't decide where I was, I would have shopped in the pharmaceuticals department instead.  But these lightweight chones with the gigantic ass-pad are better suited to fooling horrified onlookers into believing that the hapless wearer suffers uncontrollable bowel movements once off-bike.  These shorts offered fair padding on a 45-mile ride, so long as my tail was planted firmly onto the ol' Brooks B-17.When I would temporarily get off of the bike for anything... say some java at Micky-D's, or a frosty cocktail in 'Betty's Boom-Boom Room' for example, I found it necessary to tuck the gi-normous appurtenance these shorts provided from my ass-crack back into said crack... easily accomplished with a firmly/accurately-placed karate chop between tender butt cheeks... Fine shorts though, if you wear outer shorts of iron or steel.	Chris Carmichael	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/AZ7BQ096XR92O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	9	1	2014/07/20

B00OPZJDO0	Excellent buy!	These under-shorts are an excellent bargain. I'm a 32 and the Medium fit well. I wear them under regular gym shorts so that I can ride to gym and not have to exercise in traditional biking shorts.You can also wear them under any shorts if you are going trail riding or city touring. The quality seems par with more expensive shorts and the gel padding is actually on the generous side. I've owned them for about 4-6 weeks and not encountered any issues yet.Many have already commented on the picture. The picture has them turned inside out to show the padding.

B00OPZJDO0	Pass, despite the price.	Summary: I wore these once and didn't even make it a mile before I headed back to swap them for a different pair.  I took a shot because they were so cheap, but it's money wasted.  The padding is ample, albeit stuff and not at all form fitting; that's not a negative for me but it might be for some.  The fit seems true to size but the material is very thin and thereby very weak.  They're shorter than normal and offer not protection against chaffing.  When it comes ot cycling shorts you generally get MUCH longer life and a better fit the more you pay  - to a point anyway.  These seem to prove that in the opposite direction.Fit: True to size.  As other buyers have stated, the inseem is short and the legs ride up easily; there's none of the grippy silicone or elastics to keep the legs in place.  They ride up so bad that it looked like I went riding in a pair of tighty-blackies.Construction: The material is the thinnest I've ever seen in any garment I've ever bought; thin enough to be semi-transparent when normally stretched.  While this breaths easy it also forces you to wear underwear if you're not trying to flash both your junk and your crack.Durability: unkown; I won't wear them again.	C.

B00OPZJDO0	The Darn thing works.	I am an bicycle newbie and not an enthusiast.  The best that I can do is about 6 miles.  Even though I have a padded bicycle my butt hurt quite a lot.  So I purchased the underwear for added support.  It works as advertised.I ordered on Amazon and the product came from China in a really tiny envelope.  Made me think that they sent the wrong product.  Anyway it was the right product and it was torn slightly.  I sewed it up and put it on.  The XL size fit my 38 inch waist perfectly.  This is underwear only.  I put my shorts over this and I was good to go.I rode my 5.5 miles and there was no pain in the butt. Yesterday it was quite hot (35 degrees Centigrade) and there was no discomfort.  So far I have had it for one month without any issues.

B00OPZJDO0	Definitely a great value buy and therapy for the hiney!	These things are amazing for the price.  I run triathlons and usually wear a tri-suit with a much thinner chamois.  Sometimes, after a long ride, I may have a little extra soreness down there.  No problem.  I throw these on for the next day's training ride and it is like therapy.  These are much too thick to use in a triathlon, but if you are a road biker or just need something to keep the soreness away, these are amazing.  And the price can't be beat.  I bought two pair and am glad I did as I will eventually wear them out.  Don't mistake that as meaning they are poor quality.  Quality is great.  I am tempted to buy some more just to stock up.  I keep thinking I will run through these a year or two from now, will go to look for some more on Amazon, and they will be nowhere to be found.  Lastly, as others have already stated but I want to confirm, the blue padding is on the inside of the shorts.  I presume they have a picture of the shorts inside out so that you can see the padding.

B00OPZJDO0	Short Shortssss	I bought these based on the reviews and I'm overall satisfied with the padding and build quality. The biggest downsize for me is that these shorts and crazy "short." They are basically daisy dukes or like the women's boy shorts underwear. I know you wear these under shorts but they just are up to high and can affect leg circulation.I'd still recommend these as a cheap alternative to the crazy priced competitors. Shipping took approximately 9 days to get to my house which isn't bad for under $10.

B00OPZJDO0	Not What I Was Hoping For	These shorts are very light weight, kind of flimsy, and the seat padding is heavy and doesn't conform to contours.

B00OPZJDO0	Needed cushon for Hank Hill butts	It really does make riding my bike more comfortable.  With hard skinny tires, a hard skinny seat, and a hard tiny butt the bumps really kill.  If you're looking for cheap padded shorts, these are for you.  I wear them under regular exercise shorts so I don't look funny.  I can't speak for other sizes, but Medium should fit if you are really skinny.  These fall under the "Lowest Price Technically Acceptable" category, so they aren't the highest quality and probably won't cure your chronic bike butt pain if you actually bike a lot.

B00OPZJDO0	Very comfortable but does not solve the pain the butt problem	Giving 4 stars only because it didn't solve my butt pain from long term riding problem.  So if you are expecting these to solve the pain in your butt problem, then you're going to be disappointing.  However, these do add some cushion and seem to solve the chaffing problem. I had no chaffing from a 12 mile ride.  It unfortunately did not solve the pain from sitting on your butt too long problem.  My butt was hurting pretty bad by the end of the ride.  I would assume that adding a Gel seat along with these pants would provide a much better comfort level.  These breath really well and are actually very comfortable.  I have a 34 inch waist and the size Large is correct.	F. Digiovanni	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/ACMJAOOFE3HYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2014/06/19
B00OPZJDO0	They are just OK	You do get what you pay for... I usually use Endura and have always been happy with them. I wanted a pair to leave at another house and figure I would try these. I think they run large, albeit slightly. With Endura brand I would get XL, but I think Medium in these Baleaf's would be fine. The padding is minimal, but adequate for short rides - 20 miles or less. They do appear well-made. So, for under $10 you can't really go wrong AND, I should not be complaining..

B00OPZJDO0	You get what you pay for	First off, the blue is in the inside.  Second, this is my first pair of biking shorts.

B00OPZJDO0	Just what I was looking for.	I was looking for something that would let me ride comfortably in running shorts.  I also wanted additional padding for some mountain bike shorts I often wear.  The Baleaf padded underwear is the answer.  I wear size 36, the large fit well.  These are well made and a bargain at the Amazon price.  I have only a few rides on them, so far the padding seems to be holding up well.  I ride on a Brooks B15 leather saddle and don't find the padding is excessive.  I ride several times a week and will likely buy more.

B00OPZJDO0	Great, simple, and very comfortable	The material around the pad is very comfortable.  Fits smugly but not too tight.  It has great give, which is perfect for us more squat heavy fellows.  And the price is great.  I bought 3 pair to use with my spin bike.  Try finding full fledged 3x bicycle shorts with padding - good luck.  This is a great buy for anyone starting back on the road to fitness and I would definitely recommend them.

B00OPZJDO0	Don't even think about getting these....	I tested these for a 40 mile ride and it was painful to say the least.

B00OPZJDO0	Cheapo bike shorts that work kinda	TL;DR If you're a serious rider (multiple times a week, +30mi/session) you'd probably want to look elsewhere and spend more money getting better padded shorts.You really get what you pay for with these.  I'm a beginning rider and a weekend one at that.  I only ride about 30 miles a week and these work great for that.  I'm a heavy set guy so all that weight being pushed down on a little road seat, over time, can get pretty uncomfortable.  They literally, saved my ass on my first +20 mile bike ride.The pads haven't frayed or ripped open, but the padding isn't super stiff/cushion-y, and the shorts do ride up and you may need to realign or adjust as you move in and out of the seat.

B00OPZJDO0	Baleaf Men's 3D Padded Coolmax Bicycle Cycling Undewear Shorts XL	I was extremely disappointed with these bicycle shorts.  I have been doing 15 mile bike rides lately and my old shorts were wearing out.  I purchased these from Amazon based on price and the large number of positive reviews.  Before I finished 10 miles I was in so much discomfort that I stopped when I hit 10.  The padding didn't seem to be in the right place no matter how much I adjusted them.  Also, the shorts had ridden up so high that the bottom of each leg was within a few inches of the waistband.  To me, it did not feel that these shorts provided any support/comfort compared to not wearing them while biking.  I do not plan on wearing them again.

B00OPZJDO0	Nice shorts for a fairly bargain price	I'm quite happy with these shorts. The padding is comfortable and not overly intrusive or noticeable. The stretch/spandex material fits well. These are easy to wear under other shorts or sweats (and over regular undies) and you don't look like a cycling dork from wearing "real" padded bike shorts. I was able to remove the padded seat cover I had been using and can ride long distances pretty comfortably. Also easy to clean and wring dry. I'm sure fancy competition-level shorts have their place but these shorts should suit anyone, even the serious rider.	yoregano	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/A1HGO72Q5K6FFX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2014/06/13

B00OPZJDO0	well made but not for me	They are a comfortable fit around the waist and thighs but positively crushing around the groin and very uncomfortable when sitting on anything other than a bike seat. If you wear these to work then you better take a set of boxers with you cause you wont be able to go 8 hrs with these things on. After less than an hour I had to remove them  . Perhaps if I ordered 2 sizes too big then maybe they would have worked better but as it is I cant use these things at all . Its just as well I suppose , my operational range on my Pugsly is around 30 miles so its not like I do cross country marathons that last whole days, I bought these things primarily because they are so inexpensive and I WOULD like to be able to push another 10 miles out of my rides with killing my butt .  I may cut out the front of them and see if that would make them a better fit.Then just wear boxers  .They cost me less than 10 bucks so im not out much if that doesnt work and they really DO seem to be well made. Considering that others have had better experiences with these than I did im giving them 2 stars but they probably deserve a third  just for craftsmanship.Update: (in case anyone actually reads this review) I cut the whole bottom part of these out, now I can slip them over my head, hehe, the pad for the butt is still there but it hangs loose.To me it makes no difference because I wear cut off sweats and they're pretty baggy in the backside but If you wear that spandex then my solution wont work for you.	this(ladies and germs), is my pen name .Pretty cool eh?

B00OPZJDO0	Bootay Comfort - Price Performance	I bought biking shorts from a well known local retailer at ~$50 bucks.  The padding was useless and after a 30 minutes bike ride my derriere would be sore.  I saw these at AmaZon and had to give it a try.  A click of mouse, $8 dollars and my prime membership I had the shorts in 2 days.  --- I was impressed -- The padding is good.  The xxxl size fits me well  given my 40" inch waist (yea I need to loose some pounds).  OK,  the elasticity at the bottom of the shorts could be better but I did not have the "creeping up problem" some riders mentioned in other reviews.  At that price I highly recommend it.  Caveat; as I plan long (2-3 hours) I  complimented these shorts with a "Sunlite Cloud-9, Bicycle Suspension Comfort Saddle" bike seat and so with shorts and seat... I'm so gellin, I'm like Magellan!  - comfy all the way....	Gadget Man	Color: Black|Size: XXX-Large	B00CWVPDKM	/gp/pdp/profile/A25HVIAOHLFQ6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2014/06/11

B00OPZJDO0	Great shorts!	I've had no problem with these on long rides (30-50 miles is long for me), but I also always wear vaseline when riding. I haven't experienced any bunching problems. I bought a medium and I'm 5'8", 152. I probably should have purchased a small in retrospective. They are somewhat high-waisted, which I'm still getting used to. Overall, I think they are awesome (especially for the price!!) and I recommend them to all my cycling buddies.	M.

B00OPZJDO0	Very good - for the price	I've always been too cheap to buy cycling shorts, and for the most part I don't feel like I need them, but I've been doing a lot of commuting to work lately and thought maybe I'd try some.  These were so cheap, I figured what the heck.  So, they "undershorts" that are padded, and I think overly so.  Then gain, I think most shorts have too much padding.  For the price, I'm not complaining, but I'd be happier if they had half the padding they have.

B00OPZJDO0	Great porduct !!	This item has eliminated my sore ass problem 100% & I love them.The only downside is that they do get a bit warm here in central FL & I am thinking about wearing them alone as shorts as opposed to as underwear.The size ran true for me as I wear a 34' to 35' waist Wrangler jean, ordered two large pair & they fit great, even after two washings & hanger drying.It took about three weeks to arrive but from China that ain't too bad.IMHO, these are the very best defense against having a sore ass from a looong bike ride.

B00OPZJDO0	Were my expectations too high?	Although they're lycra and a chamois, I really expected more padding, wait...strike that, I NEEDED more padding and I was really hoping that I had a savior in my choice of cycling shorts.  Unfortunately, I should have just bought a higher quality pair of shorts like the Canari gels and the Sugoi RS that have replaced this pair of cycle shorts. I'm a new long distance cyclist and I needed to toughen up my backside, but my introduction was painful after only a few miles with these shorts.  My Sugoi's are top notch and although more expensive, comfort is worth every penny.

B00OPZJDO0	Provide relative comfort even on long rides	Don't like tight fitting padded bike shorts and the looser fitting shorts are too expensive for my taste.

B00OPZJDO0	The padding is not useful	I bought these since they were pretty cheap and had loads of 5 star review. But these are really not useful. Although they have padding it is worthless. I suffer multiple after ride soreness. Really not useful if you plan to go for long rides. These are cheap but not useful will suggest spending some more money and getting a proper shorts.I recently bought  Tenn Mens 8 Panel Cycling Shorts with Professional Molded Pad  and the difference was but obvious. I went for a 20 miles ride in the new short and that was really comfortable and no after ride soreness.

B00OPZJDO0	Anothet review	I've decided that there is not enough elastic in the legs. They keep riding up your l leg instead  of staying put.  Not as good as other higher brands by far.

B00OPZJDO0	Only for very short rides	They are okay for short rides I suppose, but with no gripper around the cuffs, these things will ride up quite a bit, and often.

B00OPZJDO0	You get what you pay for, not for avid cyclists	This is a bottom of the barrel padded short. After about 30 minutes the padding is so compressed that it provides no relief. It was worth a shot for the price. The shorts also ride because they don't have the grip rubber at the bottom of the legs like the higher end shorts. These would be good for a beginning rider that gets sore after 5-10 miles. So but them and expect to outgrow them performance wise in a week if you are a cycler.

B00OPZJDO0	Works great, good padding, good price.	I have found that these padded shorts have a tendency to shift around and ride up on you during a ride. I liked these because the shorts parts is a very thin lycra material that is easily adjusted and shifted.

B00OPZJDO0	Don't Hesitate Casual Biker (Helpful Reviewer)	I read some of the descriptions on size.  This is key and helped me buy the right size.  I have never owned bike shorts of any sort and I have always suffered from, what I would like to call, SBS (sore butt syndrome) from biking.  With that said, these do not cure SBS, but do give you a longer ride before it occurs. Look:  I wear shorts over these and you cannot tell that they are there.  Yes they are shown inside out, but a little overhang occurs after placed on.Comfort:  Very comfortable and easy to sit on.  Will give you a longer ride and a renewed vigor to ride more.Price: awesome, I bought two for $9.Downside:  I have yet to find one.  I do not know how long they will last after washing numerous times, but at 9 dollars they have been great.

Little did I know that they come in both black and white and they asked for my preference, so I ordered one of each color and they were received in a timely manner.  Comfortable, lightweight, and fast drying, my one recommendation would be to hand wash, or wash on gentle and line dry.  You can't beat the price, as I've paid more then double for comparable shorts.  Also, they can be worn under any pants or shorts without being self-conscience.

B00OPZJDO0	Revised	After receiving my first pair as soon as I tested them I ordered again . I have a suspension seat post and cloud 9 seat but my tail end still was sore and uncomfortable . These just plain put a stop to that problem . I order 2 sizes larger then normal and they fit fine . There is plenty of stretch except for where the padding is .  They are duo color black with padding that is either orange or blue .I tried a pair of Izumi Quest shorts they were so much better I lowered my rating here and will not recommend these to save $$$ . While these worked much better then nothing for the first 5 miles they failed and bunched up chafing on longer rides . The quests do not , stay firm in one place and are much better at soothing the rear . I would just pay up because though these help once you try the better quality shorts you won't want these despite the large improvement because the others are even that much and more better . Pay up for the real cycling shorts and forget this underwear .	Croppled1	Color: Black|Size: XXX-Large	B00CWVPDKM	/gp/pdp/profile/A22QKNGN59XYZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2014/05/22

B00OPZJDO0	Pretty good for the price	As it takes time to see if the padding will wear out quickly or not I can't give a full 5 star. However the sizing was accurate.

B00OPZJDO0	For The price I paid, it's really worthy!	I personally didn't like the padded bicycle Underwear I bought since I had butt-muscle ache even after wearing them, this means that they couldn't do their job which is comfortable biking for long distances, but they were cheap and I risked buying them. However I am now looking for another padded bicycle shorts to buy, from store and not online. Something more heavy dutyUpdate (18/06): I purchased another seat for my bike and paddled 20 miles without this shorts and then 20 miles with this short (Both on the new seat). With the new seat the Shorts functioned much better, I could feel it's benefits after 20 miles wearing it compared to 20 miles not wearing it. At least for the price I paid for it, it's nothing less than a 4 STAR!

B00OPZJDO0	Awkward bulk and displacement	As others have noted, the picture of the shorts is that of them inside-out. The padding is significant.  Had I not already built up a tolerance in my rear end, I would probably like these better.  As it is though, the padding disperses the pressure enough that when I wore them, it was as if I was starting all over again--instead of a little discomfort in a place I was used to, I now had an aggravated butt all over.  I guess at some point, no matter the padding, you're going to have to get used to it.  These shorts just made me have a problem where I didn't really have one before.  That said, and I know they are intended for riding, but even for the short time I spent walking to get on my bike etc., I couldn't help but feel like I was a two-year-old kid walking around with a diaper on.  The padding is thick; hence, it was awkward as all get out.  No thank you. I haven't worn them since. I can't really say anything about durability.  I washed them and saw they dried quickly, but I won't be wearing them again to see how they hold up.

B00OPZJDO0	Cushy Comfort	I really haven't had an opportunity for an extended ride as yet. I took a tumble on a wet deck about the time I received the underwear. But I did take a ride so as to write this review.They seem well constructed. As good as some expensive biking shorts I have had.  The padding is just the right amount for me. I'm a big guy, 46 waist, 270+ pounds, they felt very comfortable.I would say I am at the top of the size person they would comfortably fit. But that leaves a lot of sizes they will fit.I'll update this in a couple of months, when I do some serious biking.

B00OPZJDO0	For 14 year old boy	Purchased for my 14 year old son, for a mountain biking vacation. He preferred these to bicycle shorts, so he could wear his favorite shorts instead.

B00OPZJDO0	Feels like you've shat yourself	They are comfy when on a bike or on a motorcycle, but walking around, it' feels like you've got a full diaper.  The "foam/padding" absorbs sweat, and doesn't breath very much.  You end up with "wet marks" on your pants if you wear these under jeans on a hot day (riding motorcycles).  They really should have used a padding material that rejects/doesn't absorb water/sweat!

B00OPZJDO0	Not comfortable, doesn't stay in place, random pressure points.	I guess I was being too optimistic for 10 bucks but I'm just getting rid of them since they are too uncomfortable to use.  The padding is way too thick in spots and thin in others so it creates pressure points in spots.  It moves left to right so it is especially uncomfortable off the bike.  Worth spending a little extra on low end bike shorts, like the Canari brand which I have and while not the best are a great bang for the buck.	Eric N.

B00OPZJDO0	Padding good - leg portion, not so much	This is my first pair of biking shorts or liners, so I can't draw comparisons to other brands or styles, and readers can take my inexperience into account as appropriate.  That said:I found the padding adequate in the seat and crotch.  The problem I found was in the leg portion--instead of staying fixed on my legs, they bunch up in the crotch and sometimes became a source of mild discomfort/chafing.I don't think this is a function of sizing--I am a 32 waist and bought mediums, and my thighs are neither toothpicks nor tree trunks.  The legs fit snugly but without constriction when I put them on.  The problem is that the material is a pretty lightweight nylon that doesn't stay in place as I move.This doesn't happen to such a degree that I stopped wearing them--the padding still makes them a plus on the whole.  But next time, I will look for something else.	SW	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/A1SX0TH2U76CPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2014/05/15

B00OPZJDO0	Really saved my butt!	I was really getting sore and chaffed prior to purchasing the padded underwear.  Wearing the padded briefs allows me to comfortably ride for two hours before I need to rest my butt.  I followed the advise offered in a comment from another purchaser and bought one size large than what I normally wear.  They would not have fit had I ordered my normal size.  There is one big down side to this story - make sure you check the color selection prior to pressing the "place order" button.  I apparently overlooked this option and wound up with PINK padded briefs.  I have since re-ordered  this item and, oddly enough, the vendor sent me a follow-up e-mail to confirm my color selection which was listed as white even though I ordered black.  I suspect I am not the only person that had the color selection problem.  I guess I'll continue to wear my pink shorts until the black ones arrive.  Sure hope I don't get hit by a car while I'm wearing my pink undies!	Tony M	Color: Black|Size: XXX-Large	B00CWVPDKM	/gp/pdp/profile/AXHEBSLX9MPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	53	4	2014/05/14

B00OPZJDO0	Too warm and the padding sides annoying	I should have avoided these like the plague since I couldn't get them in one size smaller than needed. My initial impression from an easy hill area 17 mile ride was that the inside thigh parts were uncomfortable, it's just because of the way it's sown and it wouldn't stay flapped the right way since the sizes run so loose. And I'm not at all used to the heat on my boys. I normally wear a sport thong and it's the most comfortable thing in the world to bike or run, except for two pressure spots on my bum. While these shorts were fine for rear end padding, overall I think I'll have to wait until it gets cold enough to wear them, mainly night trips and winter. To make them comfortable, I had to roll over the waist several times, to get it from over my belly button to underneath it at the top of my hips. I'm 5'9, with a 32" waist, and weigh about 150lbs, so if they offered a small at the same or lower price would I buy these again?

B00OPZJDO0	Good purchase	These are tagged as "underwear" but are essentially cycling shorts - Thick padding & combined with the material - Very comfortable.  If they were longer they would basically be outerwear.  My guess is they were designed to be worn with a pair of regular shorts??

I bought these directly from Baleaf for 9.99 with Prime shipping. It's hard to get that deal, but I actually searched for it. Otherwise, you can buy these padded underwear from China for about 7 bucks and change. The picture on the Amazon page is an exact replica of what you'll receive (they're inside out on the Amazon page). The pad is very good, although a step below Canari biker shorts, but still very good and effective at providing padding. More than anything, you won't complaining that the saddle is too hard after riding for a while. For a few bucks, you can buy these and wear them under your regular shorts. That's what I like most about them.	Louie the Italian Jew	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B00CWVPAU0	/gp/pdp/profile/A3NID9D9WMIV01/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	39	5	2014/05/07

B00OPZJDO0	Nice product...nice price	These shorts took forever to arrive, but worked great, so I order a few more. I just can't see paying the prices I see in the bike stores for bike shorts, so when I saw the price, I thought sure they would be cheap and not work. Neither was true, so I ordered more.

B00OPZJDO0	Backside still SORE....	I mean let's be honest, you can't beat the price anywhere.

B00OPZJDO0	Thick padding and comfortable	I was pleasantly surprised with these shorts.My waist is a 36, and I purchased a large which fit fine, but I would recommend a large  even for people with a 38 inch waist, because you want a nice snug fit. The shorts are very stretchy and the padding is thick and comfortable. I have a narrow saddle on my bike which often leaves me quite sore. These shorts made a huge difference, and I'm glad I purchased them rather than a padded seat cover. In reference to the discussion about which way they should be worn, I will just add that the printing (tag) is usually worn on the inside, and that's how I wear them. I believe the shorts are advertised inside out to display the blue padding, but since they are underwear,they can be worn however one prefers.I have owned expensive chamois-lined riding shorts that I have long since outgrown. Although these are not quite as comfortable,at $10 they are approximately 1/4 the price, and in truth they far exceeded my expectations. I don't think you can do better or ask for anything more at this price, which is why I rated them with 5 stars.

B00OPZJDO0	Baleaf Coolmax riding shorts	Shorts seem to be adequately constructed, padding is a little thicker than others that have which is what I wanted but, after riding for a short while I think the extra padding may work to a disadvantage in that it seems maybe a little too much in the center of the crotch in that I experience some discomfort.  It's like it negates the center cutout in the bike saddle.	FJE	Color: Black|Size: XX-Large	B00CWVPCLM	/gp/pdp/profile/A2Y139997QJ23Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2014/05/01

B00OPZJDO0	Despise the color I got...	Meh. The pair I received were pinkish red in color with bright orange padding... not what I would consider very masculine looking. What happened to black/blue as shown in the photo? Since they were not designed to be worn on the outside I went ahead and kept them with the hope that nobody will ever see me in them. I have a 34+ inch waist and I was able to squeeze into a large size; but not without the legs riding up uncomfortably. The padding is ok and I get the price was inexpensive. But next time I will spring a little more for something better looking and of a higher quality.	edsanshead	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A2J29NOCP02WOV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	2	2014/04/23

B00OPZJDO0	Great padded shorts	Well, in the reviews everyone seemed to either like it or dislike it and not much in between.  For me these seem to be well made and could probably work as cycling shorts on short trips. I used them under some loose shorts.  I received them 1 day before this ride and so they have only been on one trip and 1 washing.  Trip was fine most of the way and after 1 ride and 1 washing they still look new.The pertinent data is:Ordered and received in two days in Texas - they must be stocking them close by now.Ordered 3 pair for 8$ each.  At 8$ you might as get more than one.Sizing: Order 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wouldMy Data: Riding again after away from the sport for 20 yearsAlmost 60 years old, two back surgeries including disk replacement and fusionToo much over 200lbs to be comfortable.After dealing with back problems for 10 years (the last surgery 2 1/2 years ago), I look like what I probably am, which is an old overweight guy that many people on todays 30 mile ride asked if I was doing ok.  This was the 4th time that I have been on an upright bike in the last 20 years.  With a tush unaccustomed to riding these shorts made a big difference. I would purchase again.

B00OPZJDO0	As posted by others they ride up.	I bought them because the price was good and there were mostly favorable reviews.  I did see a couple comments about how they tend to ride up when wearing.  I though I would give them a try anyways because of the price and the other positive reviews.  I have worn them once and will not be wearing again.  About 2 minutes into my ride the shorts were bunched up in my crotch.  I would pull them down and they would immediately ride back up.  I bought the medium size as I am a 32" waist.  The padding did seem sufficient by overall they didn't work out for me.

B00OPZJDO0	These are great for the price!	So, I like these shorts.  I also like the price!The padding is better than the 2-3x more expensive bibs I bought.The sizing, however, is not very clear.I'm 6'2" 190lb a measured 34.5 inch waist, 32 inch in most jeans I wear. I ordered a large and it's a little too loose.  I'm worried about ordering a medium and having the legs be too tight.Because the sizing is just off, It can ride up on longer rides.  The waist comes up kind of high. It doesn't go high enough to go beyond my belly button, but is short enough that it rides down. So I end up rolling it down, creating a rolled bunch at the waist and it's not the best.Maybe I'll have my wife re-do the waist line.Why aren't there more sizing charts on Amazon like there are on Ebay?

B00OPZJDO0	Padded Bike Shorts	I'm 6' 4" around 230 lbs., I tried both the Large and Mediums in these and they both seem to fit.  I like the tighter fit of the Medium's, but I haven't ridden in them yet.  I rode in the large and they work as expected; provide padding, I did 20 miles, and the discomfort was mild.  The legs do ride up so if you have any issues in the legs you might want to consider some kind of tights to go over these, if your main thing is a padded sit area these have a decent amount of padding there (I wore them under Pearl Izumi WxB barrier pants since I thought it was going to rain...it of course didn't and I wish I'd worn my shorts).At ~$11 I figure you can't go wrong with trying them out and if you don't like them not really a big deal.  I'm not sure if I'd buy more, we'll see as my riding progresses.	Opus IX	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/AAZJCG9O5KW02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2014/04/01

They are a little loose around the padding area. I wish they had a small. Also, there is no rubber grip on the legs. I mostly got them knowing that I would be wearing shorts over them.

B00OPZJDO0	relief	Well I just bought my first road bike, been riding mountain bikes for years. I have a giant, gel padded seat for my mountain bike, so a  tiny hard road bike seat was a major shock to my backside. The first time I rode it I seriously second guessed my purchase of a road bike. But after I wore these shorts it was no longer an issue. I can't really compare them to other shorts because this is my first pair, but it was a night and day difference compared to without them.

B00OPZJDO0	Feels weird but worth it.	It feels like you are wearing a diaper, or have a wedgie, but once you've ridden a ways in them, you will be ever so thankful. It has the ability to wick moisture, and the padding is shaped and contoured to not interfere with leg movement against the seat, while still doing a good job cushioning you. That's not even to mention the affordable price.	jared arand	Color: Black|Size: XXX-Large	B00CWVPDKM	/gp/pdp/profile/A3EWFBF0PYU36U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2014/03/20

B00OPZJDO0	Good pants - Sizing seems right	Delivery - These pants arrived quickly - 3cays on Amazon Prime.Function - They do the job.  I ride for maybe 1 hour a day and the padding is sufficient for that.  I wash them in the washing machine as per instructions and line dry.  They hold up to the machine and they dry quickly.Sizing - I am a 32 waist with typical thighs.  I purchased Large due to the comments that the pants run small.  The waist and the legs fit fine but the crotch are is a little roomy and sometimes it feels like distance between my cheeks and the pad is too much.  The pant legs do not ride up my thighs.  So I am not sure if a Medium would have still fit comfortably at the waist and thighs and would have held my junk in place better without squashing.  I will likely purchase a Medium for comparison and will update this review at that time.Bottom Line - Buy them.  Get them one size larger if you have any doubts.  Probably better to have extra room than be too small.	Spencer Mann	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A1R7EEQO9TC7NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2014/02/26

B00OPZJDO0	My Booty Thanks Me	The shorts fit as described for me, are not too snug nor too loose.  The padding seems to line up with the seat as one would expect.  I have taken it on 20-25 mile rides and I'd say it definitely makes a difference in the booty, however I think after about 20 miles it loses it's effectivity and I might suggest something with additional padding.  It's too early to tell how it might hold up to washing, but I have no reason to believe it would not.  Personally I think a quick handwash would be best.

B00OPZJDO0	Comfortable, but not quite enough padding	First of all, to assuage any concerns you may have, please note that the picture shows these shorts inside-out.  The blue part is on the inside when you wear them, and is not really noticeable, as it's mostly hidden between your legs.  That being said, I do have a few problems with the shorts.  First, I bought the XL size, even though I would normally wear a L.  And yet, they are still a bit too small.  But, the biggest problem of all is that the padding...doesn't fit a normal sized...manhood.  Not sure how else to put that, but let's just say your most sensitive spot is probably going to be resting right on the seam around the edge of the padding.  It was just uncomfortable during a half-hour stationary bike session, but I imagine it would be a big problem on a longer ride.  The padding just needs to extend a bit further up the front for these to really be useful.

Wore these to the second class and it was an instant difference. The one thing I would note personally is by these to the size you typically wear underwear. I noticed a lot of reviews that say they run small so I bought a size larger. I am a medium and bought large. While the fit and work fine I could tell they were too big and wished I had gone with medium. I did wash them and dried them and that helped sum. Overall good product though.

B00OPZJDO0	Lots of Camel Padding	OK, so these are cheap and they have a ton of padding so what's the issue?The issue is that the material is super thin and the legs are very short. Additionally, there's no sticky rubber on the bottom of the lets to keep them down. They ride up *all the way* and become horribly uncomfortable. I was on a ride with a Meetup group and didn't get a chance to dig them out so I was quite uncomfortable.I likely won't ever wear them again.

B00OPZJDO0	Loaded Diapers	Geez!  These things are terrible.  Tried them on and immediately put them back in the bag to return. Ordered the smallest size available (Med) for 31" waist.

Maybe they'll work for you if they fit tight....but if not, make sure you wear baggy shorts over them or people will think you have a real problem.

B00OPZJDO0	Quite good	I wasn't expecting too much considering the price, but these are quite good. I'm a 34-36 and the XL fits right and the padding is very substantial. I did a 23-mile mountain ride yesterday and they held up nicely; time will tell on durability. Perhaps not as nicely fit or slimline as the Pearl Izumis, but if you're looking for functional padded underwear you can't go far wrong at this price.

B00OPZJDO0	Does the job at a reasonable cost	These shorts greatly reduce pain on long rides without requiring the rider to dress in traditional tihgt bike garb.

B00OPZJDO0	Butt saver	I read the reviews before I purchased these. That's why I bought one size larger. the fit well and give good cushion. However, you see the lines at the bottom of the legs through your shorts. If that is a concern you should think about that. I got to try them out in January in Mobile Bay, AL, (I live in IL). They helped since I've been restricted from riding for over 3 years now. Unlike some other undershorts I have they fit well at the waist and were comfortable. I'll find out if they're too warm this summer.	Len	Color: Black|Size: XX-Large	B00CWVPCLM	/gp/pdp/profile/A1SJH8BYV7EVDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2014/02/01

B00OPZJDO0	Ahhhhhh! To ride in comfort...	Since I absolutely refuse to wear tight cycling shorts riding my mountain bike but instead prefer baggy shorts, I purchased a pair of this padded underwear for getting the best of both worlds (I wear this over a pair of Exofficio underwear to keep them cleaner). Anyway, these shorts have just the right amount of gel padding in just the right locations for a superior, comfortable ride. I'm of average build and size with a standard mountain bike seat and thoroughly enjoy the level of comfort they have added to my ride. The build quality is there and no complainst so far. In fact, I will be purchasing a second pair. Buy with confidence.	Dr Mango	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/A373LBKW0HMH4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2014/01/30

B00OPZJDO0	Great shorts, shipment issue.	I'm very happy with these shorts.  A very affordable price, a good fit, and nice and comfortable.  My only complaint if I were to have one is that they are shorter than I expected and are more a boxer brief style than I'm used to in my riding shorts.  Not a big deal though as I wear shorts or pants over them generally anyways.As for the shipment issue, I ordered two pairs of these shorts and what I got was a men's and a women's pair instead of a two pair of men's.  My wife needed a pair of shorts herself and it just happened the ones we received fit her so I didn't bother to contact the seller (Finejo).  They did deliver extremely fast (and free of charge) getting the shipment to me well before estimated.I plan on ordering a couple more eventually and will just cross my fingers.

I use these as underwear when I ride, therefore I'm able to wear any type of shorts I like.  you can't beat the price.  They are too short to actually wear as cycle shorts.  And because they are so light, wearing something over them isn't a problem. You should really wear something over them.

B00OPZJDO0	It works, but the pad it much to wide to be comfortable.	These shorts did the job, but made my rides pretty uncomfortable, and not as fun.  And isn't the whole reason for buying padded shorts to be more comfortable?  With these shorts I felt like I was wearing a huge adult diaper the whole time they were one.  It was gross.  I ended up just throwing them in a drawer and buying a $30 pair from REI that actually had a pad that was cut appropriately and provided just as much support and didn't make me feel like I was wearing a huge diaper.  I gave this product 3 stars because the padding does protect your bottom from a bumpy ride or hard seat, however you will still be uncomfortable, just for a different reason now because your wearing a huge diaper like pad.For a one or two time use, I'd say sure go for it and buy this product, but if you seriously ride like once a week or more regularly, save yourself the time and money and just buy a good pair for around $30 now instead of having to buy them later anyway.  Your going to end up buying a more comfortable pair later anyway, why waste your money?  FYI this product took approximately 2 weeks to show up, but that is what I expected when I purchased the item, so no complaint about shipping time, just letting you know.  Best of luck in your search for bike accessories!	B	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/A3UHC6T46I6Z92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2014/01/15

B00OPZJDO0	Offers Some Improvement And Comfort, But Still Got Sore	I like bicycling. I don't bicycle for longer than 15 miles too often, but when I do, I often get quite sore. I bought these padded cycling shorts with the hope that they would help me be less sore after a couple of hours in the saddle. It kind of worked.I found the shorts to fit well given amazon's size guidelines, however, the padding was really too soft for it to make a large difference in my riding comfort. The padding feels substantial at first, but I think ultimately it does not do enough to really make any kind of saddle-soreness go away. That said, I think it helped a small bit.Anyway, I was hoping for better results, but I guess nothing beats just practicing being in the saddle for long periods of time.I probably would not buy this product again, but as I've only used it for a couple of long rides, its hard to say whether or not its the product's fault, or if its my body's fault.

B00OPZJDO0	Not as comfortable as expected	I'm relatively new to biking, and picked up a pair of Peal Izumi shorts as my primary riding shorts, which are *exceptionally* comfortable and well made. At a quarter of the price, I wasn't expecting as much from this pair, but the bottom line, pardon the pun, is that they simply aren't as comfortable as my Pearl Izumi's. I don't know how much use I'll ever get out of these as a result, as I absolutely dread wearing them for rides lasting longer than about 30 minutes... which is all of them. The stitching in the waistband also seems rather flaky, so maybe they'll just deteriorate in my dresser by themselves.

B00OPZJDO0	Snug fit, padding does not last	The fit is snug (which is more comfortable if you're using a bike or stationary bike) but the padding does slim down after several washes.For the price it is a decent set of padding to get you started. If you're having pain/difficulty then consider a higher quality pair of shorts.	Griff	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/A22X55UTTJ93PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2014/01/01
B00OPZJDO0	The price brings them up a star...	As some folk mentioned... these run small... so I got the XL where I would usually get an LG and they fit well.  The waistband is thin and there's enough material that the waist almost comes up to my chest?!?  It might be worth 5-10 bucks to have them altered.  The padding is good... I like lots of padding for this 60 year old butt that puts in 80-100 miles a week.  Bottom line... these would be a three star product in my book... but they are such a bargain... I'll give them 4 stars.	ZenKen	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B00CWVPAU0	/gp/pdp/profile/A2PBPXU4TLM73H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2013/12/30
B00OPZJDO0	Very pleasantly surprised!	I bought some bib tights and did not realized that they did not having padding. I must a admit I was really unsure about wearing essentially padded underwear. I took them out for a 30 mile ride and they were comfortable with no hot spots. I am not sure how they would do on a really long ride but they held up very well on 30 mile ride.

B00OPZJDO0	It's OK.. got for motorcycle riding	My wilfe and I got these for our motorcycle rides.  Regardless of what kind of bike you have, a long rides every bit of extra padding on the rearend helps.  Padding not super thick to feel funny, but enough to raise the comfort level on our longer rides.  I'd recommend these for just that purpose.

B00OPZJDO0	A little big!	The padded look very nice and is very comfortable but it is a little large so it's not good when you're pedaling because the protection moves constantly. I would recommend ask for one less size that your underwear.	Alejandro	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/AFQCQ8YPMXP41/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2013/12/25

B00OPZJDO0	Great for long rides	I'm not a hardcore enough biker to wear an all tights outfit yet, and I needed something to help with the butt pain after long rides (I regularly ride from downtown SD to Coronado, which is about a 22 mile bike ride). These work great. It's weird and almost feels like I have a diaper on, but I would much rather have that feeling than the feeling of my bike saddle jamming into my butt for 22 miles. Sorry, I can't figure out a way to more tactfully explain it... 5 stars!	steven a. willard	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B00CWVPAU0	/gp/pdp/profile/A3NWKBA9ZXWH5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2013/12/23

B00OPZJDO0	Can't get better for twice the price.	They are a life saver, err rear saver! Be aware they are shown inside out on the pic. They are also under wear, not outer shorts.  It does feel like you have a diaper on but this is to be expected.  Some have said they are not gel.  This is incorrect. They are half and half. Some are pads are foam, some are gel.  You can't beat the price for what they are.  Don't expect them to make your ride plush and soft, that won't happen with any shorts.  They work to dampen the blows from off road riding. I plan to buy more as I ride more often than they seem to get washed.	wyleone	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00CWVP9YC	/gp/pdp/profile/A2Z0UMHDRDCS5J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2013/12/20
B00OPZJDO0	Awesome	I like to go spinning and had never tried bike shorts prior to these (primarily due to cost). After going spinning with these, I can't go back. Its much much more comfortable. The underwear looks like you're wearing a giant maxi pad, but hey, it works, and no one sees it, so who cares.

B00OPZJDO0	Considering	Considering this isn't a dedicated pair of bike shorts, I'm quite happy with the product.  It's basically a brief that turns any pair of pants or shorts into something that would work for biking.  I've tried it on longer rides and shorter ones and it seems to do fine for both.  Just don't forget a change of clothes for wherever you're going, otherwise you'll have to wear them around all day under your clothes.  Not too much of a problem but they feel a bit diaper-ish after a few hours.  But overall I'm quite pleased with it, letting me wear less clingy things since I'm in no shape for skin-tight clothing!

B00OPZJDO0	Confortable and cheap	Granted I am new to the sport, and I have never used cycling underwear before, but I think this make rides a lot more comfortable than not using anythings, while being relatively cheap. Alternatives are typically very expensive, and might be worth it for more advanced riders. This is really good, at least for beginners.

B00OPZJDO0	UPDATE Apr 2015.  Original review:You get what you pay for.	UPDATE April 28 2015:  I read another review that stated they loved the first pair and reordered and the ones they got were much poorer quality.  Just now, I may have found the cause:  If you look at these shorts, then look here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OPZJDO0/ref=pd_luc_rh_sbs_01_01_t_img_lh?ie=UTF8&psc;=1#AskYou see a totally different looking, and much nicer short!  There are almost no bad reviews on it, and it is a dollar more.  I am about to order them and will update this once I get them. DesertDave____________________________________________________________________________There is nothing "wrong" with these... they seem well made and are comfy.  the padding is not very ... 'paddy' though.  I find they work ok for shorter rides (or perhaps after I am used to riding more they be ok), but for anything over 1/2 hour I need the real gel cusioning of more expensive models.

B00OPZJDO0	Not for road cyclists	With the number of positive reviews these had, I thought I'd give them a shot. I'm a road bike cyclist and tend to average between 15-25 miles per ride.My biggest complaints with them, are the following:- The leg ends don't have any of the rubbery grips on the inside to keep them from riding up while riding.- The padding area isn't wide enough either, during the ride, my butt was going numb around the 5 mile marker and it made the ride uncomfortable. It seems that the padding doesn't really match up with the anatomy of my butt. It kinda seems like the waist was correct, however, there's a bit too much room in the butt area of the shorts which causes the padding to shift around a bit.To be fair, I'm fairly thin, 170lbs & 6ft and don't have much of a butt. Unfortunately for me, these didn't really work well for me, It was definitely to see someone making these shorts for a great price! Hopefully, in the future, they could potentially use a tighter spandex material that fit my frame better or even had a bit more contouring in the cut which may help with my issue.Anyways, I'd still recommend these to someone to try out, had they fit me better, I'd be ordering a few more pairs!	chjone	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/A3EDZ6NQVYPGFT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	21	3	2013/12/08

B00OPZJDO0	Sizes Run Small	The sizing chart is off.  Buy at least one size larger.  The legs are VERY short and bunch very easily.  They serve the purpose of a cheap $15 pair I can ride in on bad weather days and not get too upset if they get messed up.

B00OPZJDO0	Fits well, seems well made and ample padding	The photo is misleading, they're actually showing you the shorts inside-out as the blue padding goes on the inside, closer to your skin.  I suppose, it could be misleading that the tag is supposed to go on the outside??? Either way, the padding should work well.  I haven't had a chance to use them on the bike yet as it is now single-digit temps here and my road bike doesn't perform well in snow.  I'll give them a go on the trainer sometime soon and report back if there's anything wrong at that point.

B00OPZJDO0	Good padded underwear.	Two things to remember:  The photo shows them inside out.  The padding goes on the inside so they don't look as silly as the photo makes them look.  They just look like black underwear.  Second, they are underwear.  Some reviewers were under the impression that they were shorts.  You wear these under your pants and they are just fine.  They add in some much needed padding to any pair of regular pants or shorts that you might want to wear while cycling.  I have worn them a couple times so far, and I really liked them.  They have more padding than a pair or cycling shorts that I also bought.  Good product.	E.S.

B00OPZJDO0	Would Not Recommend	As others here have stated, the legs ride up, so while they fit well and are comfy and well cushioned, as I am riding they ride completely up my leg. Wont buy a 2nd pair.	Mike & Cyndi	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B00CWVPAU0	/gp/pdp/profile/A1U7LUHDTBEVH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2013/12/01
B00OPZJDO0	Great for the price	The padding is better than many of the more expensive bike shorts I own, but they are a little short for my liking. I prefer longer as these can tend to bunch up, causing me to fidget with them often. This picture has them inside out.Overall, they have successfully kept me from getting saddle sores, and I ride a pedicab for sometimes 12+ hours a day. Combine these with a little chamois cream of your choice (or vaseline which works fine but also stains), and you will be good to go.

B00OPZJDO0	Good for comfort biking, not for trail riding in rough conditions	I compared this to the Aero Tech "Mens Basic Bike Short Padded Cycling Shorts Biking Pant" during multiple rides.The Baleaf would be good for "comfort bikers" who want more padding than a standard bike short.But for rough mountain mountain biking on trails, where your butt is moving around on the saddle and being placed in front and behind for different conditions, the Aero Tech is far superior. The Baleaf definitely rides up if you move around, whereas the Aero Tech has rubber grip areas on the legs that keep it in place.I was really amazed the first time I did a rough ride with the Aero Tech. It did not move a bit and the padding was just right.My waist is 36 and XL is a good size for this product.

B00OPZJDO0	Rides up in the middle due to the short legs	I got these since I always wear shorts over my bike shorts and figured that this would save me some money.  However, when i put them on I was a little shocked at how short the legs were.  I went for about 7.5 miles on a very hilly road (very steep upward hill [also nice downhill once you get up it...]).  About half way through I found that a lot of thigh was showing (since the seat was pulling everything upward) and I found that I had some discomfort around the crotch area.  I got off the bike and could feel a big bunch of clothing around the crotch (right on the edge of padding), the legging had bundled up and was pushing into the side of the crotch and was causing chafing between the seat and the crotch, which was very uncomfortable.I returned these since I cannot use them when they bunch up around the crotch.  If these had a tighter and longer leg they would be perfect, the padding was great and the material was like nothing at all (literally, you could sort of see through it).  The padding was great, but the short legs and the bunching made these cause discomfort.I got the medium and they were a great fit (waist and leg wise), they just did not have anything to keep them down and the movement of the seat caused them to roll up toward the crotch which led to discomfort; I have about a 32-34 waist.I also want to add that the picture does show them inside out, so if you do get these you will not see the blue, although these are nearly see through so you are going to have to wear something over them.

B00OPZJDO0	I think these are great!	First off, the blue is on the inside.  Second off, I bought one of those soft seats from Walmart cause the seat on my new hardtail was hard.  I bought these and actually switched my seat back to the hard one.  It might hurt for the first few rides but now because of these shorts I ride for a few hours and don't even notice, and thats mountain biking.

B00OPZJDO0	What Relief	I ride a hybrid bike and am no bless with natural padding. I put a pad on my saddle then bought biker padded pants. This worked well until I started going over 1 hour. I now wear these under my biker bibs and get great relief. I also use then under my cargo shorts for shorter rides. The great price is just an added bonus.

B00OPZJDO0	cheap bike shorts	These shorts fit nicely and have good padding in the crotch. The problem is that the legs do not have a rubberized band like the more expensive shorts. This means that the shorts constantly ride up your leg and bunch in the groin area requiring constant adjustment. Not good. I do not wear these anymore.

B00OPZJDO0	Thin fabric	I bought this for my boyfriend who wanted extra padding for riding, when i received it i noticed the fabric was pretty thin.

Overall I think it will make his ride but better, but the picture is a bit deceiving.

B00OPZJDO0	Work well and fit is good	I wear these every time I bike now, and they make a huge difference. I can ride much longer and actually pedal harder and faster as my comfort level is so much more improved. I don't have a lingering numbness after biking, and I can actually go out for hours at a time now which I love. I'm very heavy and I ordered the XXXL and I think I actually could have gotten away with an XXL but I'm OK with the extra room since I wear them over my regular underwear to reduce the number of washings I have to put them through. Well made. Well done. Highly recommended.	Richard E. Pozzuto	Color: Black|Size: XXX-Large	B00CWVPDKM	/gp/pdp/profile/A10T1OIEMJ3MCL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	20	5	2013/11/01
B00OPZJDO0	Nice but Not Gel	These are nice and fit well.  I thought they would be padded with gel, but the pads seem to be some sort of dense foam.  They still work OK, but not as good as gel in my opinion.  The foam may be cooler than gel in hot weather so maybe that's why they are "coolmax" no "comfort max".  They are definitely a bargain and worth the price.	Ray Buckwalter	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B00CWVPAU0	/gp/pdp/profile/AD59WXOJLMYQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2013/10/31

B00OPZJDO0	Incorrectly sized	I tried to read everyone's reviews before I purchased and a couple of people mentioned they had 34" waist, which is bigger than myself and these fit, but I'm not sure how that was possible.  I mean Sure I could get them on, but there wasn't much room whatsoever and forget about comfort.  It might just be a biking thing, that the clothes are very tight, but If i knew better I would have definitely gotten a Large and I typically wear pants with a 32" waste.  The worst part is I didn't realize they were literally coming from China, so forget trying to ship them back since I only paid $15 each.  Now I'll just be looking for a friend or a female friend for these to fit.

Not only are they extremely comfortable, but they also hold up well after multiple washes, are extremely well padded and actually have more padding where it counts than some of my expensive/name brand cycling shorts.These tend to run a size small - I am an XL in absolutely everything else that I wear, and the 2XL of these is a snug fit for me. (I have a 38" waist and pretty good sized legs). The regular XL did fit, but the 2X is much more comfortable, and with something like this, in my opinion it's better to have it a little loose than too tight.Great buy all around - 5 stars from me.

B00OPZJDO0	Very Poor Quality & Fit	Not sure whether the other reviewers got a different pair of shorts, but the shorts I received are not usable for cycling or any exercise activity.The fit very loose, mostly because the fabric is so sheer you can almost see through it. They're probably half the thickness of any decent cycling short.  The padding is in places that would never touch a bicycle seat and it probably won't last very long because the blue liner material is also very thin.These shorts also have a very short inseam (about half of a normal cycling short).  They look more like cheap speedos than cycling shorts.	mydogplaysthetrumpet	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00CWVP8PC	/gp/pdp/profile/A1LKZTTXTWD4M7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	1	2013/09/05

It's pretty much the same as is included in many baggy trail bike shorts, but this allows me to use LL Bean cargo shorts, which have more useful pockets for my purposes.

B00OPZJDO0	So far so good...value!	I don't ride too much but I don't want to have a sore backside after a moderate bike ride.  I also don't want to spend $50, $100 or $190, ya $190, for a pair of athletic shorts or underwear with some sponges stitched in them with fancy names like Gel.  These are inexpensive and feel just as padded as my $50 pair.  The only question is will there be  chaffing and short durability.  I will update after a few hundred miles!  I like that I can wear any baggy shorts over them.  The reality some of us who don't have much natural padding need to look into new saddles, but a good pair of riding shorts can mitigate the damage.

Remember, these are underwear that go under your shorts and the picture is showing them inside-out so they are all black from the outside.  I like them so much I just bought two additional pairs.

B00OPZJDO0	Love these cycle underwear	8 days from china. Unbelievable. They feel great. Excellent padding. I can ride without any pain in my seat area. I'm very impressed with the feel and comfort. I'm not real big on wearing bike shorts. I feel like everything is exposed. These go under my shorts. I'm excited to ride in the morning. I would highly recommend these.

B00Z9PEITK	Honestly all of the Baleaf products I have gotten so far I have been overwhelmingly happy with. It is incredible the value of this ...	I am a working professional who cycles to work, and this makes finding bottoms that are both functional and presentable really difficult. These leggings are what I swear by!! Honestly all of the Baleaf products I have gotten so far I have been overwhelmingly happy with. It is incredible the value of this purchase, I am still blown away. I wear a pair of these every single day. They look great under button down tunics, and then I slip the tunic off after work and cycle home. No pilling, no weird spots that wear down, no scrunching at the seams when you throw them in the dryer, no show through. Also, my workout clothes tend to get a weird loss in elasticity after a month or so (I wash and dry my clothes often) not with these! So nice! They do sit a bit high on the waist even though these aren't the high waist style.I am so happy with these I bought three more and one in the capri style as well.Packages send quickly and are washed and folded and come in individual sealed bags of good quality. There is always a concern of boxes getting damaged in our awesome PNW rain, never with these. I am really impressed with the professional look and quality of this product all the way around. Shipping, presentation, sturdiness, and no color fading.A word to the wise though: don't make the mistake I did and throw these in the wash and dryer with light clothing. I think it was a towel that did it, but on a couple there is this white fluff along the seams. Totally my mistake. Beyond that, these guys are great. Wash and dry like you would any other piece of workout clothing, wear with boots and tunic, look awesome and know that you got such a good product for a steal!

B00Z9PEITK	Fanatical - Best Pair of Leggings I've Ever Owned	The best pair of leggings I own. I feel indestructable in these things. I feel like champion of the gym! (But also a great option for those of us who like to wear activewear, everywhere). These are thick enough to cover everything (not see through) and keep everything snug. The one thing I hate about thicker leggings is they get REALLY warm, but these aren't as bad as others I've owned. Great flattening of the belly effect without giving muffin top as long as you've got the appropriate size. I found the sizing chart to be accurate. I'm 5' 5", 125, muscley, about 37" around the butt and 34" around the belly button. Small fits great but is snug, order up if you like a more relaxed fit. I'm ordering in every color.

B00Z9PEITK	Awesome workout leggings.	Like all Baleaf Products I have tried so far, I really like these leggings. They are made of a very breathable, athletic fabric which still passes the squat test (Though I do order a size up for all leggings for increased comfort). They're long and high waisted, which is great. So far they seem very durable, and I enjoy working out in them.

B00Z9PEITK	Love these leggings!	I just got these and I'M IN LOVE. These leggings are so cute and comfy, and they make my legs and butt look great. Best of all, they aren't see-through! Who would guess it would be so challenging to find some pants like that??The fit itself is basically perfect. For reference, I'm 5'4 and around 140lbs, and I ordered smalls. Usually I wear a small in leggings for all other brands. These fit completely true to size! I ordered some in black and charcoal, and both colors look beautiful. Sometimes lightish gray leggings look weird or cheap, but the charcoal is very dark and true to the picture -- really great.Furthermore, the pocket is a little helpful sometimes for small things like a few hair ties or something, but it is really small. I count this as a good thing though - it doesn't make a weird lump or anything because it's so discrete. I would not want it to be much bigger. The fabric itself is not the most breathable like I would want if I were specifically shopping for leggings to work out in, but for going to work/class/lunch/whatever, these are perfect.For the price point, these leggings are incredible; they feel way more expensive than <$20. I definitely recommend them!	Amazon Customer	Color: Black|Size: Small	B00Z9PEKRK	/gp/pdp/profile/A28LYO6TWK62ME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/16

These hit me right above the hips and they keep their shape after several washe's.

Wore these for the first time today so I can't attest to how they hold up in the wash yet, but they were very comfortable and weren't too hot. My gym is air conditioned so I don't know if there is a difference in the Michigan heat though. They are fairly long. Longer than most leggings I have found, but it wasn't bad at all. I actually liked the length. Easy to roll up if you wanted to as well. They are not see through as far as I can tell!First impressions: I really like these. The look is great and the quality feels very nice on first impression and wear. Thick enough to protect my shins, but not too thick as too be stifling. As of writing this review, I would reccomend them to a friend.	seriouslyraee	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A3D37QENL82CQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/06/27
B00Z9PEITK	my new favorite leggings	These fit great.  They're thick, good quality, and I love both the burgundy color ones and the navy blue ones that I purchased.

B00Z9PEITK	Opaque & Quality Made	These are FANTASTIC. By far one of my favorite pair of leggings. I bought the black in size M (waist 27", hips 40", 5'4", 140lb) which fit perfectly and stay in place no matter how much dancing I do. These are not see-through and actually have thick, durable material. If I need another pair, I plan to reorder these.	S.

B00Z9PEITK	Great Pants!	I have bought four pairs of workout pants from this company for myself and a pair for my sister. They are thick enough to not be see through and light enough to be comfortable. So far I have found these to be much better quality than the name brands I have gotten from places like Marshall's in the past. They are true to size but if you are short like me may be a little long so you might have to bunch/fold them at the bottom a little. I would highly recommend these.

B00Z9PEITK	Not shorter than regular leggings	These are well made leggings with nice thick fabric.  If they are tight on you they may be more see through.

For reference I am 5 feet 2 in tall.  So I would say these are for people 5'4" or taller.

I've bought several pairs of these leggings in different colors and a pair of shorts from Baleaf as well. My favorite part is that they actually are completely opaque - no see-through mishaps at the gym which puts my mind at ease. Nice thick material, really comfy. Even the pairs I own that aren't black (the dark blue in particular) do not show my sweat marks - usually i only wear black leggings so you can see butt-sweat lines! Really great leggings - will continue to buy more in different colors. Last but not least after all the times I've washed and dried them they do not seem to show signs of fading/pilling.	remako	Color: Black|Size: Small	B00Z9PEKRK	/gp/pdp/profile/A2PULNMA351M2H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/06/01

B00Z9PEITK	I also am pregnant so I didn't want super high waisted	I was afraid these were going to run large, but they didn't! I had high hopes for these and I was not disspaointed! I'm around 130 lbs and 5'6" with not a very large bum or legs lol so I wasn't sure to go with small or medium because I did want a snug fit. I went with medium. I also am pregnant so I didn't want super high waisted, that would be uncomfortable or tight and hurt when I sat down. These are more high waisted than I thought they were going to be but they are NOT either of those! They're great so far! Not see through and a very nice material, also not super thick where they would be too hot to wear during the spring. And maybe some summer days. (For me anyways) because being pregnant has made me outgrow all my jeans etc, so I'm kind of stuck with leggings! Lol. Not to mention I love the way they shape my bum lol. I hope they remain this snug and don't start to bunch up around the inner thighs.. Will have to test that out soon. If not I'll definitely be purchasing more 😍😍😍 Overall, I'd definitely reccomend these!!!!!! I thought I was going to have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for good quality leggings but these are probably going to be my favs!!! 💛💛💛💛💛	Jaime	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00Z9PENFY	/gp/pdp/profile/AXJNGLOD5LTAR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/04/24

B00Z9PEITK	THESE ARE MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE LEGGINGS EVER	THESE ARE MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE LEGGINGS EVER.I am SO particular with the kind of leggings I purchase. I'm not very thin and I've got a little junk in my trunk and thighs that are pretty thick, so I have a hard time finding good leggings. Before I came across Baleaf, I was actually only buying leggings from Ross. They have a brand that makes the softest leggings ever, like almost LulaRoe kinda soft(i refuse to buy lularoe, too expensive). Anyways, I stumbled across Baleaf and thought ah what the heck lets try it. LET ME TELL YOU, these leggings are the best freaking leggings ever. I have two black and one dark gray and they fit perfectly. The length is amazing, too, because usually the leggings I get that are ankle leggings, usually end up shorter because I am 5'7 and these even have like an extra inch of length. All in all, these are the best and I hope you come out with more colors so I can buy all of them.

B00Z9PEITK	Comfy but a bit thin	Love the length (I'm 5"4") and soft material. Although this legging is NOT see-through, it gives me bad VPL, so I'd recommend seamless underwear or long tops.Will not repurchase because I want thicker leggings for strength training. Got the XS and fits perfectly with my size 26" waist.However, I washed it once and the parts of the inner seams showed fraying. I had to cut off these threads so that the leggings will look normal. I'm worried this will continue with subsequent washes and ruin my leggings. Will update review if it happens.	munsterkitty	Color: Gothic Grape|Size: X-Small	B01IEKL57E	/gp/pdp/profile/A1GAT0CBGTTDOD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/04/21
B00Z9PEITK	Comfortable, durable, and not seethrough	Worth it!  I found these on a buzzfeed.com list of amazon items, and they caught my attention because they were specifically noted as not being see through, which is a major concern for me.  I have had a few different people "check" them on me and they are not see through even when stretching or squatting.  I have both purple and black, and the finish on them is semi-matte rather than shiny, which I also like.  I've washed them several times and they seem to be holding up well.  I'm 5'3" and 130-135lbs and bought mediums, they fit fine because of the wide waistband.  I think a large would have also fit me.  I recommend them.	meredith mansfield	Color: Gothic Grape|Size: Medium	B01IEKL6GE	/gp/pdp/profile/A1G2SAX9I8XYUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/04/21

B00Z9PEITK	Update on my previous review~	I first bought a size S and it did run big around my waist. So, I had to return them, The seller offered me to try size XS and surprisingly it turned out to be much better than what I expected. I found the size S to be see through and I was concerned that one size smaller will be very tight and probably even more see through but it does not. I should mention that I always wear seamless panties underneath of my workout gym and it is just fine but it might still be a bit see through if you wear some other types of panties with strong lines. I also like the length of these leggings. It makes you look taller. So, I think the product is good if you can get a right size for you.

B00Z9PEITK	Love these!	I LOVE these! I am 5'0 and somewhere between 105-110 lbs so the XS fits me great. Since I am short they do bunch up around the ankles but not enough to bother me. They are very flattering on the waist and they stay put even during vigorous exercise - I wear them for BJJ, hiking, and running and they never slide down. They are durable--I took them out on a nice hike that involved rock climbing and a lot of slippage--even though I was sliding down rocks and dirt at many points, these leggings stayed intact! Someone close to your butt might be able to see panty lines, but they are definitely not see through if you're my size. As far as the pockets, you can fit a credit card/ID card in there and maybe your keys too. While I can fit my phone upright in the pocket but it will fall out if you try running with a phone like that.Pro-tip: Hang dry, wash cold, and do not use fabric softener! This will extend the life of your leggings.These are half the price of the leggings I bought at Target but the Baleaf leggings are so much better as far as comfort, durability, and price.

B00Z9PEITK	I really liked these leggings	I really liked these leggings. Not too expensive, pretty comfty, and good reviews. My only complaint is that it's like an odd black color. It's not like 100% black. I wore these casually one time with a black coat, and the black didn't match the black on my coat. It sounds dumb, but if you're like me and wanted versatile leggings I could match with a school outfit and then switch into a gym outfit, then I wouldn't recommend these.

B00Z9PEITK	The item is good considering its price	The item is good considering its price. I scored three starts at first because of fit. But the customer service was incredible. I think they're monitoring all the feedback of the customers. I left a feedback, "I know I am kinda slim so I ordered a slightly smaller size than I usually wear but it still somewhat large than I expected." and they responded my feedback. I didn't ask returning it because it fitted anyway but they responded so nicely. A textile has somewhat less tension than I expected. But, if you considering its low price, the item is quite great though.	Amazon Customer	Color: Black|Size: Small	B00Z9PEKRK	/gp/pdp/profile/A3FDWF0FGH6CGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/03/22

About 130-135 lbs and 5'3. I bought these in both a medium and small in black but the small was definitely the better fit. I would say I am at the larger end of the small fitting, without it being overly tight. The medium was definitely too loose and tends to sag down through the butt. I kept it because I didn't realize it stretched a little and didn't fit until I washed/wore them. Comes to somewhere between hips and the waist, to a comfortable and flattering point. Were not see-through and appear to be decent at sweat wicking (I wear them for both derby and pleasure and they've held up nicely)	Amazon Customer	Color: Black|Size: Small	B00Z9PEKRK	/gp/pdp/profile/ASEQGFJY21A6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/03/20

B00Z9PEITK	Love these	I love these. I like that the material is thicker but still wicks away sweat. They are not at all see through and have a flat stitch which reduces friction on the threading as my thighs rub together as I run. Although the length of the small is a little long - it goes down past my ankle to midfoot - in fairness I'm really short at 4'10". I've also bought several pairs of the yoga capri pants and would recommend both.	K.

B00Z9PEITK	although it is a bit snug I felt like a medium may have been too big	I ordered a small based on reviews and sizing chart, although it is a bit snug I felt like a medium may have been too  big. I'm 5'2 or 3", 123 lbs, my hips are 34in, right above the belly button which is where these pants came up to I'm 31in, and length was good. Just to give you an idea of fit. Quality is amazing. Definitely not see through! Relativity thick material and comfy. 4 stars only because it's a tad snug that's why I included all my measurements to help future buyers.

B00Z9PEITK	Absolutely LOVE.	Absolutely LOVE. I'm 5'9", 170lbs, and I vary between a 10 and 14, depending on the fit. Bought a large, and it fits wonderfully. It also goes all the way down to my ankles, which rarely happens for me with yoga pants (they usually end up a weird high-water length). Normally on workout/yoga pants, I prefer drawstrings to prevent them from slipping too low while running and stretching, but the waist fits perfectly. After 10+ washes, it still fits well. Bought it in two other colors after falling in love with my first order. Highly recommend!

B00Z9PEITK	Totally opaque, BUT...	These leggings arrived quickly and at first I was VERY pleased with them. They are not transparent AT ALL and they have a good heft to them - the little inner pocket is nice for holding your ID or CC when at the gym. They fit very well and go up high enough that they hold my lower tummy in and are long enough that they go all the way down comfortably to my ankles even when pulled all the way up at my waist.I however do not use these for gyming purposes I use them for daily wear and I have become quite displeased with the quality. Now perhaps I am way too hard on my leggings, both literally and figuratively, but these leggings have shown wear very quickly. They started to pill after the first wash and have now after about 15 wears gotten large tears at the seams in my inner thighs and have large pills there that are very hard to remove. I have given them 3 stars for the fact that these are the first leggings i have found that are totally opaque and fit so well. I wish they had held up better.

B00Z9PEITK	Just as good as the expensive brands!	I'm so glad I listened to the reviews and got these. They are just as good, if not better than my expensive ones! I agree they are not see through. I was really worried because of the mixed reviews. My only gripe is they still bunch at the ankles on my 5'4" short thick legs. I included a picture bending over showing they aren't see through and a picture of them bunching at my ankles. In the picture bending over, I'm wearing seamless hipster undies under them. I'm pregnant and they are very soft, stretchy and forgiving. I'm 5'4" 140-145lbs, and carry my weight in my bottom half. The medium fits me well with nice give. I suppose they may run slightly big. If you're between sizes, size down. I will no longer be paying $70 at athleta for leggings because these are better!

B00Z9PEITK	Would buy again	These are nice quality leggings. They are slightly see through so I wouldn't promise that you can't see through them but not bad enough that I won't wear them to the gym with a longer shirt. Considering the price though they are very reasonable. I'm 5'5 about 135 athletic build and I bought a small and they fit nicely but not tight where you feel held in them. Comparable to lululemon pants (size 8 is loose, size 6 tight) which are thicker and I feel like they hold my body nicely. Overall if you don't want to pay the Lululemon price, these are a good option.

B00Z9PEITK	Surprisingly happy so far	I'm a bigger woman (just over 200lbs and 5'2''). I was very worried about ordering these online as they only look like they would only fit someone who is much smaller than myself. I ordered them in an XL which is my usual size for leggings. These fit just snug enough to hold in my baby belly. The material feels like they will last a long time and won't loosen too much with wash and wear. They are pretty long for me but I am abnormally short and I usually wear uggs or boots of some sort so it doesn't really bother me. Really happy so far.

However, I tried them on right away after I got them and I was fine until I sat on my lambskin rug and I got lint all over the legging. I tried the same thing with my another brand of legging I purchased the same day and I had no problems with another brand. Other than that they are so soft and comfy!

There is not much sheen to the fabric so they do collect debris (pet hair, stuff from the ground if you're doing floor work at the gym), but I don't see that as a big deal for workout clothes.

B00Z9PEITK	Perfect leggings	I am obsessed with these leggings. I wore them for the first time yesterday to the gym.I am 5'6 131 pounds. I ordered size small in the red wine color. I mainly lift weights so I do a lot of squatting, dead lifting, etc. Yesterday was leg day so I was excited to try these out. The color is awesome. It was exactly what I wanted. A burgundy-like color. The leggings fit perfectly. Showed off my curves without being too revealing. The material is fairly thick and not see-through. I know because I tested them in the mirror before going. Also, without anything underneath lol. These do not show anything. They were long enough, not too baggy at the ankles, and the waist was a good fit. It even has a small pocket in the waist. I have never owned Lulu leggings but I am willing to bet these are a great alternative to them. Just very conforming and sexy. I didn't have any issues and will be buying more colors.	R.

The medium size is perfect (I wear a size 4-6 in jeans, for reference) and doesn't leave me with the dreaded muffin top. They are also not see-through at all.I own these in four colors: black, blue, purple, and gray. The gray is my least favorite because the material is a little softer and more cloth-like, whereas the others have that slick workout-like cloth that I love. I wear them all regularly at the gym and around the house.All in all, I highly recommend these.

B00Z9PEITK	Fantastic legging for the price, even for tall gals!	I was skeptical to find a great pair of everyday wear/athletic leggings on amazon...for less than 20 bucks, no less.  But my skepticism was in vain.  These are lovely.  The thickness is ideal for all activities, they don't scoot down off of your hips after while, and they don't dig into anywhere uncomfortably.  They really are a stellar pair of leggings and I'm inclined to get them in gray now too!  I'm tall, and they come up to an inch or so below the belly button and fall just at the ankle on my body.  For reference, I ordered a size medium and I am 5'10" 165lbs, of the normal-athletic build.

The fit was okay, but I could tell right away that they were see-through. That was my number one goal with this purchase...non see-through leggings, which is how they were incorrectly described. The fabric was also stiff and the seam was uncomfortable. I will be returning these.

B00Z9PEITK	Great for the price!	I was pleasantly surprised by these leggings for the price. They're definitely a "sporty" material. Thicker material, not see through at all.I've worn them at least 5 times and have washed them multiple times.The reason I'm giving them a 4/5 is for two reasons. First, they arrived with mysterious white marks, similar to deodorant marks, right out of the package. I was able to remove the marks with a sponge. When I contacted Amazon, they said I could return them but I didn't want to since I was pleased with how they fit. The other reason is that they are starting to pill a little between the thighs. This is expected considering I've worn them a few times. I've had it happen with much more expensive leggings. Nonetheless, I'm displeased and hope that their quality stands up.For reference, I ordered an XL and found that they fit true to size. They're a little long but I'm short so that's normal and doesn't affect my review. Depending on how they hold up, I might order another pair.

I'm a small in most active wear bottoms but I would suggest into looking to size up. This was really tight on me and gave me a muffin top. The waist rise isn't high enough even on my short torso but it's also a bit wide since I'm short and my obliques turn to muffin tops when the rise is not right. I wouldn't want a low rise anyways since I squat and bend forward and I need butt crack coverage. Not for me.

B00Z9PEITK	Great inexpensive leggings!	These are a great product for the price. I purchased the black leggings in medium (I'm 5'7" and 135-140 pounds depending on the day) and they fit as expected. I think I could have gotten away with a small for more compression, but I'm happy with the medium. Pros: great length (some leggings are way too long), comfortable around the waist, don't show ANYTHING they aren't supposed to. Cons: can't think of any! I'm planning on purchasing the other colors. These definitely aren't the same quality as lululemon, but for they price, they are a steal!

B00Z9PEITK	I like it, very comfortable...	To start with, I'm 5'2, 135lbs, and pear shaped. For my first purchase, I ordered a small because I figured my hips and thighs would be more comfortable in it and I was right, but it bunched up on my ankles because of my height. It was a snug fit on my hips and butt at first, but the longer I wore it the more I felt it stretched out, I always had to pull it up from just walking.My second purchase, I learned from this and ordered an extra small. It actually fit well lengthwise and though it was a little tight around my hips and thighs, I knew it will stretch. For now though, it's helping me suck in what chubs I have on my lower tummy.Great to work out with, not itchy, not see-through, and comfortable enough for casual wear.

B00Z9PEITK	Buying a second pair	I bought these pants months ago because they promised not to be see through. I have now worn and washed them several times and the fabric has held up well. I don't do reviews often, but as I'm looking to purchase a second pair I thought I might as well share that these are great workout or casual leggings, especially for the price. Also, the material is not too thick, but it's durable. I do not overheat in warm weather or feel cold through them in cold weather. My second favorite pair of black leggings as from Victoria's Secret, but they are too thick and tend to make me overheat. These are perfect.

B00Z9PEITK	Nice, not see-through!	General notes: Material is opaque (not see through), however this may be slightly diminished in some colors. Quality is good, no visible/obvious flaws in construction. Price is great.Specifics (pluses and potential concerns): These leggings are made of highly stretchy fabric and I would not suggest getting a larger than usual size unless a looser fit is desired (or you have a lot of 'junk in the trunk', a size up may help ensure these will be opaque). The pocket is integrated between the two layers of the waistband, which I prefer over other methods to include a pocket in active wear garment designs. The length is a bit longer than ideal for me, but not a deal breaker (could be a plus if you're taller though!). They passed the 'bend over test', which is important to me when buying leggings.I bought these in size small (color: black); for reference I am 5'1.5", 118lbs, 32G and 28" inseam.(Photos are a close up of fabric, and the other shows the slight bagginess at the back of the knee due to length)	Ms. Amara	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A1I5S7QTGMMV82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2017/01/11

My legs and waist is sized for a medium but because I have a bigger butt I got a large. I'm 5'5" and 150 pounds. They fit but don't compress around my legs like I would like.

B00Z9PEITK	So great!!!!	These leggings are completely worth the investment! They are actually solid and non-see through. They fit very comfortably and are size accurate. I can't afford high-end brand name leggings (and have friends that have some) and so far they are just as good. The pocket is only small enough to a house key and credit cards or (other things of that size), so anyone with a very big phone will need another way to hold it.

B00Z9PEITK	Good pair of leggings, panty lines do show though	This fit really well. It's soft, stretchy, high waisted, not too thick or bulky. I've used it for yoga and felt pretty comfortable in them. I got the XS one in purple and rusty-red (I'm 5' 3' at 116 lbs). It fit perfectly in-terms of the waist and length of the leggings. It's not see through, but very, very form fitting, so VPL is an issue.Overall, it's comfortable, the colors are bright and the pants "look" expensive. But don't expect the same quality as Athleta or Lululemon. There's a degree on translucency in the material that shows what you're wearing underneath (i.e. panty lines).	kaleidoscope	Color: Gothic Grape|Size: X-Small	B01IEKL57E	/gp/pdp/profile/A2Q0YYZH8L272V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/01/08

They are slightly see through  (you can see the white tag through the back) but not enough to be uncomfortable or obvious in the gym. I am 5'3, 148 lbs and got a medium. Everything fits nice except the waist is a bit looser than I would have liked and they're a tad bit long but what leggings aren't when you're this short. I'm definitely going to buy another pair and will stick with the mediums for now, hoping they'll shrink a little when I wash them.

B00Z9PEITK	Honest review	Let me start off with the fact that I have been looking for hours for workout tights that are not expensive but have great reviews, hold up, are durable during high intensity workouts, weight lifting, and can use them to hike. I came across this brand a year ago and bought my first pair in black. I loved it. But I lost it. Haha. Then I bought another pair in black and the material is amazing. It's thick enough in a way that you can wear them out in the fall (not freezing weather though) but they are breathable, flexible and make it through an intense workout. I do a lot of high intensity workouts and some strength training, along with hiking and they hold up amazing. No rips, tears, wear out.So, I saw that they finally had more colors available. I was always scared to buy colored leggings because I was afraid that my-already-big-thighs would look even bigger. But I took a chance anyways because I HAD TO LET THAT GO. I bought these in navy blue, the dark purple, and wine one. The colors were beautiful and package was in good condition.I am 5ft5inches. Waist 32, Hips 36 about 150. The medium fit perfect. It's very stretchy and does not bunch up too much at the bottom. There is a little pocket for keys but won't fit my Samsung GALAXY s7.The only "issue" was that for the black one I got, a lot of lint stuck to it. But that's it. Other than that, I really recommend these leggings. Especially if you're looking inexpensive workout tights or just for lounging around.

It snugs perfectly. I can go jogging, do yoga, go to the gyms with this legging. It's thick, but comfortable. It keeps you warm, but not hot. Makes your butt looks good. The inner pocket is a plus for a bit of cash, your card on the go while jogging. It hits right on the ankle, so there's no weird scrunching.

B00Z9PEITK	Excellent find & buy!	These are awesome, high quality tights! Perfect for every age group and activity. They quickly became my favorite yoga and travel tights but I've also worn them outdoor rock climbing and running. They don't chafe, the material hasn't worn and they stay put and never let your butt hang out like some pairs that ride down. The band on top is a double layer of the material and is the perfect size to hide any tummy pooch or love handles. These are awesome for the holidays for this reason. I'm going to label them all-year round tights because the material is not soft and fuzzy like some, it's durable and breathable at the same time and I can already tell they'll last a long time. Do yourself or your favorite lady a favor and buy more than 1 pair.	Amazon Customer	Color: Charcoal|Size: Medium	B01G1KNPZE	/gp/pdp/profile/ATBMAMU8V42SY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/12/23

B00Z9PEITK	Great product with one exception	These are great! With one exception. First the pros:High quality - felt silky smooth while stretching etc - Felt very competitive with the SUPER expensive brands popular where I work out like Splits 59 ($100 leggings anyone? no thank you!)Truly opaque - none of the dreaded see through leggings problemsGREAT price! - cheaper than old navy activewear and feels much better qualityQuick shipping and all that jazzCon:I ordered the wine color and was SUPER excited. My favorite instructor where I work out has a pair of maroon leggings and I had always thought they looked so great so I was thrilled when I saw these. Plus perfect time for Christmas since they're kind of a Christmasy color. WELL, apparently she doesn't sweat much in class. These really show WHERE you sweat, and I had no idea I sweat quite so much in my crotch. So thanks baleaf for enlightening me on that subject. Really it might not be a problem if you're just lifting weights, running, cycling etc but for me, I bought them for barre where we "tuck" which is basically pelvic thrusting to the outside observer. So it was during a set of tucking while facing the mirror, knees apart, I discovered I looked like I had wet my pants! I thought it might be a shadow from the lighting in the studio, but no, it was definitely sweat giving off the appearance of having had an accident. I now know why almost all of my activewear is black! But really, I do have a few sets of leggings in both green and purple that I haven't noticed this problem with (though they tread a dangerous line between stretchy and see - through).So overall these are OK, definitely not see through, but I think I'd take borderline see through for sweat showing so horribly like it does. I may still wear these occasionally, and I'll probably order more from Baleaf but NOT in the "wine" color. Maybe this isn't an issue for you, but if you do barre don't order red!	nezume	Color: Ruby Wine|Size: Large	B0192VE9UE	/gp/pdp/profile/A3K5SC6YVLD662/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	3	2016/12/15

B00Z9PEITK	These leggings are good for the price	These leggings are really good for the price. Very comfortable and the material is quality, nice and thick. They are pretty long but I'm on the short side and not super thin (5'3" and 145lbs) but my legs are longish for my body (my torso is short with a high waste). The medium fits well with maybe just a tad more looseness around the knee area than I would prefer but it's not a deal breaker. I probably would have been able to wear a small in the leg area but the medium is very comfortable around my waist area as I have very little natural curve. The color is nice and I feel it is accurately pictured (I got the estate blue). The fit is pretty true to size. Overall, I think these will be very good for yoga and I'm satisfied with the purchase.

I am 5'4 125 and these fit great they are a little long so i just flip the hem up once and go about my day. These are no see through at all and are great for working out. No sweat comes through and you can bend down with out worry. They have began to get little rolls like a peeling sweater would in the thigh area and I dont know if it is from washing or my legs rubbing together when I walk but either way I am not too bothered by it and plan on buying another pair in black.	briana	Color: Charcoal|Size: Medium	B01G1KNPZE	/gp/pdp/profile/A2800RF4R3VQ8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	4	2016/12/12

B00Z9PEITK	These are by far the best workout leggings that I have ever purchased	These are by far the best workout leggings that I have ever purchased. I ordered two pairs, large and extra large. I am 5"7 198 lbs. The large fit fit quite snug but wasn't uncomfortable. The only reason why I ordered an xl is because I don't like my pants to sit on my hips, I like to pull them high up on my waist. I wish there were a wider variety of colors. Also, with pants that I've previously owned they would roll down at the waist creating a bulge at the stomach area, but these pants hold tight and do not adjust until you adjust them.

B00Z9PEITK	Great leggings for the gym and for daily use	After a few wears, I actually bought another pair because I was very happy with these. They are form-fitting as one qould expect from this type of legging, so they are pretty flattering. They're definitely opaque, and fairly thick but still quite comfortable. Since they're fairly thick, I don't feel especially cold outside as the temperature drops; I find the warmth fairly comparable to jeans that are on the thinner side.I have worn these to the gym and I also wear them for daily use. I don't feel weird using them as pants.I never use the little pocket, but I guess it's a nice feature for anyone who might need to put their ID or credit card somewhere. The logo is on the left near the top, so if you're wearing a fairly short shirt it is visible. I usually wear sweaters or tank tops and they cover the logo fine. They are also not seamless, rather the seams are definitely visible, but I don't think they're unsightly or anything, they're just there.Also, I bought a size small, and they fit wonderfully. I'm 5'2" and 120lbs for reference. They're slightly long but I usually wear boots over them anyway, and at the gym I just fold the bottom up, so that doesn't bother me at all. Honestly, I've given up finding reasonably-priced bottoms that are the right length.

B00Z9PEITK	They're Okay.	I have to be honest that these pants let me down a little bit. I'm a huge fan of Baleaf's athletic pants with the side pockets, so I thought I would like these (I have four pairs of the other ones, even though there are only three colors). I've been hoping they would come out with new colors in the side pocketed pants, but they haven't, so I decided to order these.These pants are a completely different material, more cotton-like and less spandex-like. They're still athletic pants in that they're stretchy, but they're not as stretchy/spandex'y (if that makes sense). I liked the color and they fit nice and look, however, the material was a let down in that it somewhat collects lent. It also may be a little less opaque than the other ones.Overall, they're okay, but to be fair I'm comparing them to Baleaf's side pocketed pants, and these just don't compare.

I wear them every day so considering that they've held up well with minor pilling between my upper thighs. The only downside is dog hair does stick to them, but I have yet to find a pair of leggings dog hair doesn't stick too and this pair is not as bad as some. Fuzzies and sweaters/clothing do not stick which is great. Dog hair is easily removed with washing or a pet roller. In summary I love these and will be ordering another pair and some colors.

They kept my legs warm, my dress didn't stick to my legs, and they sucked my stomach in a bit! I'm sure they're great workout leggings, too. I'm considering getting a second pair.

B00Z9PEITK	Two thumbs up!	I've had these for a little over a month and these are definitely my go to leggings. They feel pleasant on the skin, look nice, keep you warm but not sweating oh and of course NOT SEE THROUGH!!! . So they are great for anything... from exercising to wearing with a nice shirt. And they are super cheap! Which is even greater.I purchased two of these, the first ones that came weren't stitched properly so I had to return those, (return processed the same day! Super awesome.) And the others were worth the little inconvenience.  I will be buying them again.NOTE: The other pants/leggings aren't necessarily made from the same material. Make sure to read the description.

B00Z9PEITK	Staple Work-out Wardrobe Item	5'2", 125 lbs, purchased small. I really enjoy these leggings, I bought 2 pairs of black and grey. The fit was just perfect and length was barely too long which works just fine when pulled up a little at the calves/shins(see photos). They are of pretty great quality, not on the high end of some of my other pairs with more flexibility in the sewing on the waistband, like champion. But, for only $17 these are such a great set of leggings to have. I'll be buying a few more that's for sure!

B00Z9PEITK	Decent Leggings!	For the price, I am pleased with the leggings. They tend to slide down a little and need to be pulled up but I do like the way they fit when they are in the right place, and I think all leggings have to be readjusted to some extent. I like the way the inside of them feels against my skin! They are also very flattering. I think a pretty good deal for the quality. I don't regret buying them.

B00Z9PEITK	Super soft material, bit on the thin side.	These pants are made of a soft material, comfortable on, a bit on the thin side. The size small were see-thru for me (when I bent over) but a size medium pair was completely opaque (also fit otherwise, just a little long but nothing that can't be fixed by cuffing them). I am 5'6 and 125 pounds, but do have a pretty big butt and thick thighs.  I definitely appreciate that these had free-returns because I think it's almost impossible to buy leggings without being able to try on! Thanks amazon!

B00Z9PEITK	Wonderful quality. A go-to, must-have legging.	I absolutely love these. I held out on posting a review so I could wear and wash them frequently for a month before leaving a review. Usually, by this point, leggings would have pilled at the thighs, faded, or gotten holes at the seams. I can't distinguish a difference in this pair from when I bought them. And say goodbye to butt-crack! These truly are not see-through!***UPDATE: I've been wearing the same pair at least twice a week since I bought them FIVE MONTHS ago! They are still going strong. I'm kind of in disbelief.	Holly	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00Z9PENFY	/gp/pdp/profile/A2QQAXI26O6VJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/10/24

B00Z9PEITK	Quality comfort-NOT SEE THROUGH.	The 1st thing I did with these pants is the "bend over test!!" I was curious just like most of you reading this review. I bought 2 colors and I couldn't believe the mixed reviews on whether or not the pants were see through.  I took the pictures with a flash, so you see a glare, but THEY ARE NOT SEE THROUGH. Reviews claiming otherwise likely ordered pants that were too tight making them thinner and see through. I am 5'9" and 138 lbs and a medium fit well. You could be 5'7 to 5'9" and weigh up to 148 and get by with a medium. I ordered black and purple and I'm reluctant to keep the purple pair. While they're not see through, for some reason, I feel more exposed in the purple lighter pair than the black pair. My husband thinks they both look great, and maybe I'm being self-conscious. If they had a gray color in medium, that would have been my preference. Obviously darker colors are going to better conceal any imperfections on the back of your thighs. Also, go commando because you'll definitely see panty lines. Hope this helps!!

B00Z9PEITK	Definitely a great buy, would recommend to anyone	I've been in the market for a good pair of leggings. Normally I'm "iffy" about buying clothing online, specifically pants because I'm slim but am curvy around my hips, thighs, and butt. I figured I'll try these leggings because reviews seemed positive and it was at a relatively low price - and I'm so glad I did. These fit beauuuutifully, maybe the best pair I've ever owned period. They fit like compression leggings, but don't have that uncomfortable vice grip that some have. And it's very flattering to my figure, plus I don't comprise comfortability; they're very soft and keep good warmth but breathe. And the length was perfect. Definitely going to buy a couple of more in black and some other colors, too.

I've bought work out leggings from all the big companies, and I was so surprised when I tried these on. They are an amazing value. They're a nice quality thicker fabric, they don't show through. They've got a good amount of compression, but not to much that is uncomfortable. The leggings move with you and are wonderful for my daily biking tights.

I have big, athletic thighs and trying to find leggings are accommodate in a modest, not-at-all-2016 way gets pretty tough. These are great though. Definitely recommend! Haven't washed, but brand new they're not at all see through and fit perfectly.

B00Z9PEITK	Dress them up or work them out!	First off, let me be the first to say that I have not worn jeans in over 2 years. I have no shame, but I also know good leggings when I see them. These leggings fit every desire I have ever had for a good pair of leggings at a good, sturdy price. I always order a size larger when it comes to leggings because you never know how they are going to fit, especially when it comes to ordering them online. I ordered my normal size in these, however, and they fit great! When I first got them, I thought they looked a little small, but they were perfect. I couldn't be happier. The reason I did not put 5 stars, however, was that the waist band is a little too thick for my pleasure. Not that it really matters, because I love them anyways. I would most certainly order these leggings again!	Chelsie Hartley	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00Z9PEPQG	/gp/pdp/profile/A3KOITWT8R2II0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2016/10/09

B00Z9PEITK	Perfect leggings for lounging and working out!	I ordered these leggings in red after seeing all of the positive reviews. I absolutely love them! They have a similar look and feel to Lululemons. I am 5'5" and about 120 pounds with an athletic build. I ordered an XS since I usually wear a size 2 or 0 pants and dresses. The fit is as expected and form fitting but not too tight. The waist goes up slightly higher than most leggings and the end up the pants hits right at the ankle with no bunching. These are a good material to wear while lounging around or while working out. The only downside is that the pocket is very small and could not hold more than a credit card or ID and a pair of keys. However, this is a minor issue and overall the leggings are definitely worth it. I plan on purchasing more colors!

Not too tight at all. No pinching or making awful muffin top! I actually feel slimmer wearing these pants. The material feels soft and smooth. They are 100% not see through.

B00Z9PEITK	Disappointing	Well shoot, I was really hoping that I had found the perfect leggings. Unfortunately, these are very thin and see through! I always do the "bend over look through" to check leggings and I could see everything. Would probably be okay with a shirt/dress covering the back. I will be returning these. They also ran just a little big and I felt like they would stretch out throughout a day of wearing. I'm 5'3, 135lbs and ordered the medium.

B00Z9PEITK	These are A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!	I put some real thought into picking these pants.I read reviews on several different ones, and decided to go with this one.I am curvy and go to the gym 5 days a week. It's hard to find a pair of workout pants that stay up and fit my thunder thighs.These are amazing! Initially when I recieved my package, I opened them and instantly was like these are not going to fit. I put them on and fell in love. They are not super frustratingly high like some pants. They sit comfortably and stay in place. They fit my thighs and butt. The best part, the material. I still sweat through them, didn't have any problems with sliding on the gym equipment after cardio and being covered in sweat.Most important part Ladys, you can't see through them. I can't state that enough. They are black and non see through. They hold everything in place and I don't know if it was a placebo effect or not but my joints seemed to feel a tad better post workout. Plus, I felt like a star with them hugging every curve. Love, love and love. I am ordering 2 more!

B00Z9PEITK	Super comfy	These leggings are super comfy and stretchy. As most leggings, they are very form fitting, so if this is a concern for you, you may want to go a size up. They are perfect to workout in and to wear in general if you are not fond of actual pants. I am 5'4 115 lbs and can usually wear XS pants. I got a small and it fits perfectly, I'm glad I didn't go with the XS. Would recommend.

B00Z9PEITK	They are KIND OF see through.	On a scale of 1-10 (1 being panty hose, 10 being jeans) of "see through-ness" I'll give these a 7. I'll wear in public for general walking about, but I won't be downward dogging in front of the entire public at my gym. Softness though.... O.... M.... G.... soooo soft. Huge bonus. I'm 5'10, usually a size 14 in bottoms. I got the XL. Length and size are great for me.

I'm normally a size 12-13 (XL) in US sizes and based on reviews went with the XL and they fit PERFECTLY! They are thick (I chose the black thick ones) completely opaque, even when I bend over and move around, smooth in the front and back (no embarrassing camel toe and such) and hug my body amazingly.

They are very opaque, fit nicely and hold up their shape with wear, are a great color, are comfortably tight without being painfully tight, and arrived super quickly.

B00Z9PEITK	In love	So i got this on the search for the perfect pair of leggings, these weren't intended to workout.. I got them in black at first and well there were the holy grail.. I LOVE these.. They are not at all see through, they are not shiny, they almost feel like cotton of course they are not (i think) but they are thick and stretch enough so they put everything in place, they are VERY black, they do have these seams on the sides that kind of show they are workout pants but those don't bother me at all..Then, i got them in gray and wine, i do have to say that the wine one is not as stretchy as the black one.. It is somehow softier but still thick and not seethrough i do like it, i just expected it to be a little darker.. The gray one still haven't tried it yet..

B00Z9PEITK	It was ALMOST perfect.	READ ALL THE WAY THROUGH.This is a recommended buy!!!I love leggings all most as much as the next white girl. My problem is, however, is that I have a huge butt. With leggings I normally have to wear shirts that cover my butt and be really careful because it stretches too thin and you can see through them. These leggings had really good reviews, and I had high hopes, but they still ended up being see through. HOWEVER. They were only slightly see through. They weren't transparent like normal leggings are, so that was nice at least.Now onto the positive stuff!These were awesome otherwise. I get cold easily, so these are really nice because they are thicker. I'm also 5'8", so the fact that these roll a little at the end because they are too long is awesome. They have a form fitting waist, which I was pleasantly surprised to find. I have muscular thighs and a fat butt but my waist is smaller, so the fact that it managed to fit all 3 was awesome.I wear a pant size between 8-12, and I got these leggings in a large, in the color Charcoal. I really love these leggings, so honestly the partially see throughness of them doesn't bother me :)	Amazon Customer	Color: Charcoal|Size: Large	B01G1KNRT8	/gp/pdp/profile/A2F4OKB4UVUMIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	4	2016/09/26

B00Z9PEITK	Already ordering more colors!	I've always been hesitant to order clothes online, but thought I would give these a try since the reviews were pretty good.  The pair I ordered arrived in the mail yesterday and was neatly packaged in a sort of waterproof ziploc baggy.  I was worried they'd be too small after I took them out of the packaging, but once I tried them on I was really happy with how they fit.  The fabric is so incredibly soft and feels really nice on my skin.  I did the squat test to see if they were see through, and I was very happy to see that they were not!  I've been wearing them all day today and they are so comfortable.  I have yet to try them with exercising to see how well they hold up to a little sweat.  Just for reference, I'm 5'2", 120 lbs, 28 inch waist, 35 inch hips, and ~28 inch inseam.  The small fit perfectly, although a little long so I have to cuff them, but the same can be said about most pants I buy. #shortpeopleproblems	chocobakes	Color: Estate Blue|Size: Small	B015C9SIJS	/gp/pdp/profile/A1ATRXMYB8V801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/09/23
B00Z9PEITK	Great fit but seams rips	When I first ordered these leggings, I was so excited. They fit perfectly and were not see through at all. The fabric feels high quality and the price was so good I ordered two pairs. Several people asked me if they were Lululemon. However, as soon as I machine washed the leggings according to the instructions (light cycle), the seams on the side began ripping. I know these are still cheap and I don't expect them to hold up forever, but seam ripping after one wash when they fit well is extremely frustrating.

B00Z9PEITK	These are by far the BEST! I must start off by mentioning that none ...	For reference I am 5'8" and 150 pounds. I purchased these leggings, the Spalding Women's Ankle Leggings, and the Champion Women's Absolute Workout Leggings all in a size medium. These are by far the BEST! I must start off by mentioning that none of the leggings I bought were see-through. The Spalding Women's Ankle Leggings were my least favorite as they felt like more of a true cotton fabric, the seams were already somewhat coming apart on the sides of the legs, and they were overall just too short on my legs. The Champion Women's Absolute Workout Leggings had more of a spandex feel to them and the material had a slight sheen to it, they were the perfect length on my legs, but I found that they were tighter on my calves and were too loose around my thighs. I love the Baleaf Women's Ankle Leggings because they feel like the perfect mix between cotton and spandex fabric, there's no sheen to the fabric, they are the perfect length on my legs, they fit snug, but not too snug, and most of all they are the cheapest between the three options. I returned the Spalding and Champion brand leggings and bought 3 more pairs of these. My new go to leggings!

I went for a run this morning and they did slide down a little but I just think I didnt pull them up on my legs enough. Im sure I wont have a problem with them tomorrow. It was only about 45 degrees this morning and they kept me warm. I cant wait for the others to arrive.Update: I wore them today and they were perfect. I didnt have to fuss with them at all. The slipping must have been a fluke. :)	CCSistad	Color: Charcoal|Size: Medium	B01G1KNPZE	/gp/pdp/profile/A5TET6138R6OT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/09/20
B00Z9PEITK	Fits amazingly!	LOVE THESE. I'm a skeptical when it comes to buying clothes online because you can never really trust it to fit you 100%, and I'm definitely more curvy which makes one size sometimes be different in different clothes. But I followed the sizing chart and put the leggings on when I got them and they fit perfectly! They have a nice feel to them and are very slimming! Not see-through at all.

B00Z9PEITK	Great quality and fit for the price - not see through!	I ordered these leggings after a "what people are buying on Amazon today" Buzzfeed post went up where they were mentioned, and I'm glad I took the risk to order them. They are made of a nice, thick material and aren't at all see through when you are moving in them. I ordered a size small, and I'm 5'2" and around 120-125lbs...I typically wear around a size 4-6. They are made to fit tight and don't sit too low on my hips when bending and moving around, but they are lower rise. If you are particularly tall or want them to pull down over the top of a pair of figure skates, you may want to try ordering up a size for extra length.If you want an inexpensive pair of leggings/athletic tights/workout pants and don't want to spend a ton, these are a great deal for the quality of the product you are receiving. They fit and feel great and I hope they will hold up to all the workouts, skating sessions and general wear I'm about to subject them to!

B00Z9PEITK	Are they see through? Well, kind of.	I like these leggings. They fit well in my usual size, are soft and stretchy and comfortable, and not too excessively long on my 5' frame. Here's the big question, though: are they see through? I have the black and navy (blue iris) colors, and the answer is: sort of. I did the bend-over test in a few different rooms in my house, and in some lights they looked completely opaque and in some lights they were, yes, a bit see-through in the butt area. I debated sending them back, but honestly, most leggings are kind of see-through if you bend over in certain lights, and I pretty much always have my butt covered when I wear leggings as pants anyway, so I kept them and even ordered a second pair in black. The softness and otherwise great fit won over the slight sheerness. I like the actual color of the black iris pair less (it's not as dark as it looks here), so I'm on the fence about those, but they fit and feel the same.

B00Z9PEITK	Perfect	I got a large, if you wear medium and you're on the line of medium or large then read this review and hopefully I can help.I would normally buy medium pants because I like a tight fit, but I have thick hips and a large butt so my thighs would be fine but I was worried that with the size of my butt they'd be see through if I ordered a medium. I'm 5'2, 150 pounds and most of that weight are my hips and butt. So I asked the people who've ordered some said get the medium but most said large. I listened and I'm so happy I did, it fits perfectly they aren't too tight, they aren't see through and the feel amazing on my skin, I don't feel naked wearing them, but I also don't feel sweaty and hot either. Yoga pants are meant to be tight fitting so ordering a large won't make them baggy they look like a regular size medium pants bit they fit perfectly they make me look slim. They feel so good. I think these will be my go to yoga pants from now on, they're cheap and great quality. I love them more than my Pink ones and trust me that's saying a lot.I hope this review helped, just remember it's better to order a size too big than a size too small. And you can always return it if you need to.	TheHonestReview	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00Z9PEPQG	/gp/pdp/profile/AZBBUQ8KAMZWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	8	5	2016/08/31

B00Z9PEITK	Great pair of pants	I ordered a size medium. These pants are fantastic! They are just as luxurious feeling as my expensive name brand gym leggings.  They have a little bit of compression in them, but not much.  This is fine for me because high compression pants generally come in material with a sheen to it, which I don't care for.  These are opaque and pass the see-through test. I am 5'6, 160lbs, and athletic build for reference.

B00Z9PEITK	Perfect leggings	The fabric is very decent, compared to athletic leggings by Nike, at a much lower price. It holds after washing, without shrinking or altering the fabric's appearance. It is not see through as other cheaper leggings, and is somewhat thick, providing good coverage (I have come across other leggings that turn see through once you put them on!) Suffice it to say I bought a second pair. Since these have a casual look to them, they can ve used for other purposes not just athletic wear.

B00Z9PEITK	I got the large at first because that were her measurements but it came too large AND she likes them nice and snug/tight on her	I got this for my girlfriend because she likes leggings for both cold days and for when she does yoga. I got the large at first because that were her measurements but it came too large AND she likes them nice and snug/tight on her body. I got the medium for her then and that one was tighter/more snug and she kind of liked but but it wasn't as tight as she was hoping. The waist is very tall and goes to her belly button and it is very loose. The thing is though, she has another pair of leggings that is size 14 (little bigger than large using size chart) and those fit her really well around the butt and thighs but loose in the ankles. This Baleaf pair we ordered (medium) is size 8 and is still too big. She says she'll wear them though and hopefully they shrink.

Sits relatively high on my waist, but I don't mind as that is my preference. Not at all see through. I have found that the material has begun pilling a little at the inner thigh after wearing them semi-frequently for several months, but it so far hasn't damaged the structural integrity of the fabric. Waist stays in place really well and doesn't ride down for me at all, but I'm also not doing especially high impact stuff. I do find them to be quick drying and reasonably warm in cool weather, without being uncomfortable in warmer weather.

B00Z9PEITK	Awesome Gym Leggins	Awesome love em they stay up and do not sag they are great workout leggins and very comfy to.The only draw back is if you are using a dry towel it will Cole t lint as all blacks do.So I would suggest using one of those cold towels that stay damp and is lint free.These are in just as good as Danskin and to me Danskin is the best.So yes great workout leggins status dry dose not stick to you when you sweat fits great and washes great to.	misscuddie	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00Z9PENFY	/gp/pdp/profile/AU41VUCS9O1K5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/06/03

B00Z9PEITK	Great travel leggings that become favorites once you get home too	I bought a bunch of items at the last minute before a trip to Portland. I knew I wanted to pack light and not take too much, bringing flexible pieces that would pack and wear easily.  These turned out to be a great choice.  They don't pill, they are very thick, they don't make a noise, they have a very wide, comfy waistband.  I brought a few pairs of black leggings - these and ones I already owned.  I loved these so much that I hand washed them at my Air BnB the first night, hung them up over the shower rod and they were dry in the morning!  I ended up wearing them every day of my trip and it made putting outfits together super easy. If you pair these with a black athletic tank and sneakers, you can then layer over a different top every day. At night, I threw on some short little dresses with flats and was ready to go out.  I recommend buying 2 pairs so you can handwash and let dry if you are traveling, or have one to wear while one is in the wash - they are so versatile that you'll probably wear a lot too!

B00Z9PEITK	Great gym leggings.	Love the color, love the way they fit. I was worried that sweat would be very noticeable with this color, but it's not too bad. They are a little bit long for me, but I have short legs, so I'm used to that. It's high-waisted, which I prefer. The material does attract lots of hair and dust particles, but it removes fast with a lint roller. There is some pilling on the bum, but it's not that noticeable. The logo print is peeling off, though that's not a deal breaker for me. I do like these for budget gym leggings. I will most likely buy more in different colors.

B00Z9PEITK	mostly great	Wife loves the material and the fit. But she did say that they were better for low intensity workouts. The reason she gave is because the waistband is not a tight as some other brands and therefor can slip a bit during activities like dancing, running, and the like. But for walking, lifting weights, and low intensity activity, there are her favorite exercise pants.

B00Z9PEITK	Comfy, but big booty beware!!	These leggings are definitely comfortable and stretchy, and they're really great for working out as far as flexibility goes. Unfortunately, they do NOT pass the "bend test" for me...in fact, they don't even pass the "resting" test for me--meaning they're relatively see through all the time, but it's hardly noticeable until you bend. I have a pretty big booty, and I've been on the hunt for a nice, thick, breathable pair of running pants/leggings to wear, I was really hoping that these would work for me because of all the positive reviews saying they pass the "bend test," but nope! That's the only reason they lost a star though. They're still super comfortable, nice material, and plenty thick in all areas except the booty!! Really comfortable waistband, too, which is a huge plus :)I'd recommend these as a nice under layer for girls with bigger butts--for under shorts or under baggier pants for those colder running days, but in my opinion, they're not suitable to wear alone, unless you have a long shirt on that's going to keep your bottom covered. They're probably great for girls with smaller butts, too. Not bad for the price, regardless. I've purchased much more expensive leggings that are way more see through and not as comfortable.

They are not see through from what I've experienced but if they fit too tight and are stretched beyond their capabilities, the pants can only do so much. I'm 5'4 and they fit perfectly, just a little left to fold at the bottom but they look fine if they aren't folded. I will update with a picture and see how they hold up over time.

You don't have to worry about "see-thru" yoga pants issue, as these are not sheer and don't show any inkling of underwear beneath.  I even tried them with full coverage underwear and you couldn't tell.  I am guilty of the "spare tire" around your middle issue due to medical issues, but the band at the top of the pants helps to mask that, which makes me less self-conscious about this issue. I am planning to buy more of these.  Worth your money.	AppleADay89	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00Z9PENFY	/gp/pdp/profile/AY8BDC7UL5ABX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/04/14

B00Z9PEITK	Works for outside fitness or club nights with the girls.	I like to slight compression they provide however they do get warm and you will see your butt outline on the bench every time you get up if you do heavy work outs and sweat at all.  I will most be using these on running days, outside workouts and winter days. Inside the gym days= no way. Also, not sheen in anyway like spandex  so dog hair or stuff from the floor will stick to you and show.  They do look good enough to wear as non workout pants too.

B00Z9PEITK	Favorite Leggings!!!	I cannot recommend these enough! If you are considering them, buy them. They solid, not see through, and such a soft comfortable material! I bought them for the gym, but I like them so much I kept them for lounge wear and casually wearing around (I'm on the leggings in public defensive! Wear them as pants if you want!!) As I mentioned, they aren't see through, so I feel comfortable wearing them out for quick errands not worried that my butt is on display. I have washed mine a ton (like I said, I wear them A LOT), and they have completely held up. Also, being 6 foot tall it is hard to find anything long enough for my giraffe legs, and these leggings reached past my ankle bones! I say reachED instead of reach because they have shortened since washing them... Probably my fault, I don't use delicate wash/dry cycles, and I only remember to use cold water half the time... Now they're capris, or ankle pants on good days, and I still LOVE them.	A. Paige	Color: Ruby Wine|Size: Large	B0192VE9UE	/gp/pdp/profile/A1P83I2Q33MTS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2016/04/01

B00Z9PEITK	This would be my favorite leggings if they fit	About me: I an 5'1" and weigh about 105-110 so I am very skinny and have no buttThe leggings: reading my description and the size chart, I was sure the extra small would fit me cause 0s usually do but when I got this and tried it on. The bottom had a bunch of ruffles which sucks as a short girl but that was my only problem with it. That's why I knocked off a star. If you look at the photo you can see how ruffled it is on my right leg and how much I need to fold it over on my left leg. The legging material is AMAZING. I normally like the very sleek spanz material leggings cause they just feel nicer but these feel like that but more cottony but it's perfect! I want more leggings with this material! And also this material seems super  stretchy so if you're a bit bigger than me I think you are fine! As for the bend over test, I did not notice my underwear through these leggings but they do kind of expand a bit if that makes sense. You can't notice your underwear but it seems like it's on the verge of showing it but if you have a bigger butt than me then you might need to worry a little bit but I think it should be okay.Shipping: so the shipping took a little bit longer than I thought which kind of sucked but I also had a blizzard so that definetily made sense. It was in a zippered up bag inside of another bag which wasn't the best shipping but it was fineUPDATE*****so late time I checked to see if the leggings were see through, it was in artificial light but I checked when I wore it again and it was definitely see through	Nickey	Color: Black|Size: X-Small	B0109UMGZC	/gp/pdp/profile/A2PDL3235YDCU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	11	4	2016/03/24

After reading the reviews I ordered these in a large. I'm usually a medium, but the large fits perfectly! The fabric is definitely breathable, but can also feel a little warm at times (especially if you're using them to work out in). The fabric seems like it could start to pill and one review said the same so I would recommend not drying these in the dryer. I just hang mine on a drying rack and they're still holding up fine! Overall, just order at least a size up from what you'd normally wear and you'll probably love these so much they'll become your go-to exercising leggings. They're definitely my favorite now.

B00Z9PEITK	Oh so comfy!!!	I love these. I was only wearing the yoga pants for the longest while. Then I ordered a pair of these and two pairs from another company, and I love all of them! These are so comfortable I could stay in them all day. I read a review before I purchased from a woman that said she was 6' 3" and these were plenty long enough for her, well if thats the case she must have pigme legs, because I'm 5' 8" but I have a 34" inseam they do fit for working out just fine, and are long enough. If I run out to the store with them on afterwards I do have to pull them down a few times, just because I hate MJ pants, and don't want my ankles showing. I like my pants long, but these are great, I would just love one or two more inches, but thats just a preference. Its almost impossible to find them as long as these are, so I'm not complaining just a preference! I still would NOT give them back so that should tell you all you need to know! :)	Edith	Color: Black|Size: Large	B00Z9PEPQG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2KO2ND52X6YPD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/03/10

B00Z9PEITK	Really comfy and long	Either I have shorter legs than I thought or Baleaf makes their leggings really long. I bought 2 different styles and on both I have a good inch of extra fabric bunched at my ankle. It's doesn't impair my workout in any way so I'm not going to fault them, just something to keep in mind especially if you're petite (I'm 5'7"). Also run a little large but not to the point to where they are baggy or anything. Super lightweight and flexible material, but not in a cheap way. They feel really well made and are so comfy I almost want to wear them when I'm not at the gym. These are going to be excellent for summer...love them!

B00Z9PEITK	Great for short girls with muscular thighs	As someone with huge, muscular, thunder thighs but can only stand up to 5ft/2in, black tights were a necessity. But the RIGHT black tights were hard to find until the girlfriend I worked out with came in with these tights but in grey, however, that wasn't the only thing that caught my eye. They hugged her curves in all the right places that I couldn't stop staring and complimenting how good she looked in them! I recently just got mines, and I go by the motto of "don't expect too much or you'll just get disappointed" but ohhh boy, these babies don't disappoint.  I believe I look like how I gawked at my friend on, because my stubborn love handles disappeared with the comfy and not too thin of a waistband, my thighs looked toned, and the ooh girl, the LENGTH. Like I said earlier, I am a short person so it's unflattering to have pants that bunch up in the ankles, and luckily, these only fold over a few times; barely making ankle bundles. The material is breathable and movable, just how I like it when I workout.  I do not regret this purchase and am looking forward to more in the future!

B00Z9PEITK	Like a second skin!	These are one of the most comfortable pairs of yoga pants ever made. Seriously. I'm in love.The pocket isn't much, but it's enough for a key or something small. I personally don't use it, but it's nice to have as an option. The color is true to the picture. I love the dark maroon.The one caution I'll give you is to not wear these if you're uncomfortable getting your lower half checked out. I say that because this fabrics clings *very* close to your body. I love this fact because I'm newly into bodybuilding and like being able to see ever line of muscle through the pants. However, that means these pants probably wouldn't be super forgiving if you had some cellulite you're trying to work off. They fit like a second skin, and trust me, without a long enough shirt all eyes will be on your booty.	Bonnie E.

This is for a small locker/house key or cash etc. It's a secret pocket so you don't carry everything during a work out.These leggings are compression material, but there was little compression to them. Not a problem though, I like how they feel! I am 5'6" and usually use a size 14, or a 1X in plus sizes. If the sizes are just S/M/L/XL then I use XL.These fit as expected, and did not cut into my stomach. The band is comfortable.They are long enough to reach all the way down my ankles to the top of my foot!Arrived on time!My measurements are 47/38/47, and the XL fit perfectly.4 stars because they are a bit sheer around the bum.

B00Z9PEITK	Good quality, relatively short	These are comfortable and fit well. They have not shown any pilling (at least weekly usage for the past four months). These are short compared to most other leggings, which works out well for me (5'2", the small was the perfect length for me), but would not be great for slightly taller people. The inner pocket is pretty small; a key and ID fit well, but even a small wallet (e.g. a mini mighty wallet) will result in an uncomfortable bulge at the waist. I do wish the waist band was tighter, but with a bit more stretch; as it is now, it sits comfortably on my waist when I put them on, but not very snugly, so it does shift down once I start moving.	e	Color: Black|Size: Small	B00Z9PEKRK	/gp/pdp/profile/A302TI2SB2W4B5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2016/02/23

B00Z9PEITK	I'm super bummed about these leggings	I'm super bummed about these leggings. For reference I am 5'10 140lbs and pretty in shape. I was looking forward to these to work out in. The fit is as expected. I have a tiny waist and rather muscular thighs so rarely do leggings fit my waist unless they are super high waisted which I've learned to live with but these were super see through. When I bent over you could see my booty and thong straight through these leggings. I'm so sad!! The reviews were so good but they just didn't work out for me. I ordered a black and a blue pair but since I wore the black I will just keep them and wear them with longer tops but the blue will be going back (inser sad face here)	K.Lawson	Color: Black|Size: Small	B00Z9PEKRK	/gp/pdp/profile/ACW8EP9LYES7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	2	2016/02/22

However, I had bought them with the intent on wearing them to the gym and I don't think that these are acceptable gym wear. They are a bit see through when bending over. I would definitely buy again as regular leggings to wear on a daily basis, but just not for the gym.

B00Z9PEITK	Pleasantly surprised	I LOVE these pants, they fit beautifully, and the texture is amazing. I didn't realize that they are workout pants, not yoga pants when I purchased them. I was very happy when I realized that they are actually workout pants and they are perfect for running! Mine came with a tiny hole in the thigh, but nothing I couldn't fix. They are extremely breathable, stretchy, and soft. I want to buy more! I was weary on buying pants online, especially for this price, but I am glad that I did, because I couldn't have been happier. High end quality, without the high end price. I definitely recommend these pants.Also, they look really TINY when you first get them and take them out of the package, much like they would fit a 14 year old. My first impression was "These are NOT a medium, these are more like an extra small.." But, after trying them on anyway with some wishful thinking that they would actually fit, they did. So they look small when they are by themselves, but they fit great.	Jessica Slater	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B00Z9PENFY	/gp/pdp/profile/A2TFO45OI9QB5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/01/22

B00Z9PEITK	Great quality for the price - just wish the waistband were tighter!	I ordered these leggings for working out. As others have said, the material is pretty great quality for the price! They're nice and opaque, and I like how they're not too incredibly stretchy, keeping everything in place. This pair of leggings will definitely last me a while, and the key pocket is handy! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that they DO tend to fall down just a little bit when you run. I've definitely experienced worse slipping with other pairs, but I've also owned pairs that have a waistband strong enough to stay put while running. If there was one thing I'd change about these leggings, I would make the waistband a little more sturdy so they stay up under any circumstance. But for the price, definitely not a bad pair at all! If you're planning on buying these for workouts, I would recommend wearing them for something a little less active like yoga or Pilates. Would purchase again!

B00Z9PEITK	Generally a good buy	I generally really like the leggings. I am 5'9" and 130 lb, with a bigger butt and bigger hips, so I ordered a medium and I am glad I did. They are snug and fit well. My only complaint is that they are thin and slightly see through, and a little short but I am also tall. Generally a good buy for $16.00.

B00Z9PEITK	Not for the gym....	Sooooo I jus got these and couldn't wait to try them on. I read the reviews before I ordered and there were more good than bad......WELL.... should have listened to the bad reviews. Don't get me wrong, these leggings are soooo comfortable but there's a price that comes with it. Boy are these thin! I ordered a large becaude because of the reviews some people said they were probably see through because they had to stretch more and probably would be better in a bigger size. I normally wear a medium so I ordered a large. You could see straight through them once I put them on. Panty lines and all. I changed into some black boy shorts under and you could still see them. Returning stuff is such a hassle to me especially when I expect better so I'll keep them and wear them for home workouts and will wear shorts on top when I go to the gym since they allow me to move freely. Now, I ordered a pair of grey leggings from 90 Degree by Reflex and these are the leggings you want!!! I'm kicking myself for not following my gut and ordering the black pair from them and taken Bayleaf out of the equation.

B00Z9PEITK	Not gross but awesome	I am shocked that these are so cheap. I got them in Large because I keep getting fatter everyday and they fit like a glove. The pocket could fit a key or a lip balm.

B00Z9PEITK	Comfy but see-through.	I'm 5'7" and ~135lbs. I usually wear a size 4. The small fit really nicely on me, but I do NOT recommend these for anything you do any type of stretching for (yoga, Zumba, squats, lunges, etc). They're really comfortable for lounging, but are a little see-through for working out! Either wear underwear that matches your skin tone, or pass on these altogether.

B00Z9PEITK	It's a love hate relationship!	So I just got these leggings in the mail. I tried them on right away. I have a love hate relationship with them.... when I first opened the package and looked at them they looked really small!  But when I put them on they fit fine and they didn't have to stretch a ton either. I love the price.  I love that they feel amazing ,they are so comfortable! They are very thin almost feels like you're not wearing anything they would be great in the summer. On the other hand they aren't great for fall and winter.  The over all fit is good the only complaint is the waist band is not very snug fitting so I feel like I would be pulling them up if I was to run in them. Here is the hate part... they are somewhat see through! It's not super bad but I'm a real stickler for not wearing see though leggings! I'm beginning  to think non see though leggings just don't exist. I've tried probably over 20 pairs and they are all somewhat see though.  These pants would be amazing if they were just a bit thicker so they weren't see through.

B00Z9PEITK	Great for the price!	Super comfy, above what I expected. Only downfall is when squatting you can see through them. So wearing longer tanks/shirts will be required when wearing them. Over all, very pleased!Update - Once you are outside in the natural light you can see through them even without squating. Disappointed about that. Had to go from 4 stars to 3.	Tonya S.

B00Z9PEITK	Can't believe how great these are	These are FANTASTIC! I was skeptical at first about the quality based on their price, but I was wrong. They're comfortable and fit well, don't roll or sag, and when I bend over they're just a TOUCH see-through, but nothing as bad as some of the other cheaper activewear I've bought in the past. I'm 5'7" and 190lbs and the XL fit perfectly. I highly recommend these to anyone and will be purchasing more Baleaf products in the future.

They do not feel super tight like some leggings can, yet they do the job that it intended.  They is a real lightness to the material, and it holds its shape even after a workout.

B00Z9PEITK	Leggings slide down BUT excellent customer service	UPDATE: I changed my review to 3 stars because after I posted my original review, the company contacted me to offer me a full refund and mentioned my comments would go to the design team. I don't know if that will actually happen, but I was impressed that they reached out, and the refund processed in under 24 hours.These are not worth it. They are an off-black, which is not a big deal, just something to be wary of. My problem is the leggings fit, but I could hear the elastic popping before I even had to tug them over my hips. Also, they rest on my hips and then slide down, leaving me with an unattractive muffin top. If not for those things, they are actually kinda comfy. Disappointed because now I have to buy another pair of leggings from somewhere else.	Mariah R.

B00Z9PEITK	Holy crap.	I work at a gym, so I know good activewear when I see it. This is fantastic, I recommend it to anyone who comes into the gym who can't afford the super expensive stuff they sell! The pocket is just big enough for a SMALL iPod or a house key or such. Not gonna fit your phone. But I weight 180 pounds, I'm 5'0" and carry most weight in my thighs, so, pants like these can be horrible, either see through or too tight on the thighs, BUT these are perfect. They're opaque and solid. And fit perfectly around thighs AND waist. I'll be buying more of these for work.

B00Z9PEITK	For the price not bad..	I'm almost 5'6 and weigh about 170 lbs and I purchased a medium based on the reviews I read. Overall I like the fit. They're not tight or see through but I probably would've been better off getting the large just because I have really muscular legs and around my quads the material looks a little overstretched (material starts to look shiny) but not see through. I can't complain. I'll update after I use them for a workout to see how the hold up. Probably will purchase a large to see what I like better but overall not bad for the price.

If you're not petite, this will probably look more like capris on you. I purchased a Medium but as I'm losing weight, I would probably purchase a size Small. The waist has already started to feel a bit lose but not terribly. It does not slip off for me. I only wear it to the gym but I haven't worn it out running. I probably won't. For running, I prefer brands that specialize in wicking sweat like Nike or Under Armour. But I do love this for just the gym. I'm probably going to be purchasing more.

B00Z9PEITK	Does seller know what black looks like? :(	Very soft and comfy leggings..however, sad to say this is not a true black by any means. This is much more of a charcoal black or gray black so if you're buying this be aware of that. If you don't mind the color, I say get this. I'm quite petite , 5 feet 1 inch and 100 pounds, the XS fits almost perfect.	summer	Color: Black|Size: X-Small	B0109UMGZC	/gp/pdp/profile/A2EB231YQN8NHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	14	3	2015/09/28

B00Z9PEITK	Love these leggings!	These fit perfectly and are super comfy! I have Champion brand leggings and these resemble those quite a bit. The seams are clean stiched, and hardly noticeable. I love the hidden pocket! I am 5'9 and I weigh about 130 pounds and a small fits perfectly. These hit right above my ankle, which is expected of most leggings because I am quite tall. As for the color, they are a lighter shade than black when worn with black clothing, but aren't a problem when worn with other clothing. These are very soft and comfortable and are not see through when you bend over.

I ordered a large, I am curvy though the hips and this dress fit through the hips and waist.  The length is right for my height.  The thing I did not like about it is that the arm holes are too large and the neckline came a bit too low (side boob and nip slip too loose/low)  So the straps need to be shortened or I will always have to wear with a tank top.  The material is pretty thin so it's see though when the light comes from behind you. Since I got it for this 100 degree weather, the thin material is fine with me.  I don't plan on going out to eat in this dress.

B005SG0GYG	Not that great.	I originally ordered a S. It was the perfect length (I'm 5'7") but I exchanged it for an XS because I have a smaller chest and it fit a bit funny in the chest area. Well after washing the XS, it shrunk and it is now Capri length on me. Material isn't the greatest -- it's a hard cotton and pretty see through. Thank goodness I didn't spend much on this dress. Word of advice, buy from Amazon because they offer free returns. One of the biggest drawback of buying clothing online is that you don't get to try it on before purchasing.

I'm 5'6" and if you are any shorter you might need to hem it: I do need to gather it when I go up stairs but it's kinda fun. Super comfortable. Casual on it's own but easily dressed up. Well worth it. Loose enough to be forgiving of my little tum, but fitted enough to demonstrate I do in fact have a waist.

B005SG0GYG	fit well but poor quality for the price	Update- contacted seller asking for a return and they were unresponsive. I do not recommend purchasing from this seller or purchasing this very low quality item.fit well but poor quality for the price. There is no hem on the bottom of the dress. I am 5'7" and it dragged on the floor, much too long. The bottom is unhemmed crooked cut fabric. Material feels like a cheap t shirt- likely will rip easily.

B005SG0GYG	Great fit & color, needed some altering	I loved this dress as soon as I put it on! It is very comfy and a great length for me and I think it falls nicely around the hips and tummy BUT the arm holes are big and baggy (???maybe my bust is not large enough for the Medium???)  I'm 5'9", 130lbs, 36B, a medium is usually my size, like I said it fit great around my midsection and the length was perfect...I couldn't wait to wear it, so simply altered the straps at the shoulders and now it fits great around the bust. I bought the eco navy, it's a great color and not see-through.  I will buy another color. Might try a small next to see if it fits better around the bust but I'm afraid it won't be long enough...

B005SG0GYG	Not what I expected	The dress was too small and the bottom was not even sewn. It literally was just cut along the bottom.

B005SG0GYG	Make lemonade out of the lemons.	Mine arrived smelling like menthol and was sprinkled in pet hair and/or loose white fibers from another item (my dress is supposed to be black but looks charcoal grey). Bummed me the hell out bc it is a nicely cur dress. Quite long. Thin breathable cotton with a little stretch. Perfect for summer. It could be dressed up or down. This is going to need a cold wash and lint rolling. Idk if it came from Hondurus (where it is made) like this or someone returned it like this but if they did theyre pretty trifling. But if the vendor shipped it out knowing it was like this they too should be ashamed. I'm pissed I cant find the dust bag or I'd exchange it. Smh such is life.

B005SG0GYG	Thin Material but Good Fit and Wear	The material is thin (if the sun is shining on you, your silhouette is going to show), but well made and comfortable.

In an air conditioned environment, it would be absolutely perfect.  I live in Northern California where the summers can be very hot and dry, and I am not comfortable in clothes that seem heavy.

B005SG0GYG	Great dress (even after 2 years) but Seller---please hem them!!	I have bought this dress multiple times because I love it so much.  The fabric is fantastic, very comfy and not too see-through,  cut large enough in the tummy to be forgiving.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that these are unhemmed!  As others have said, they are very long (which is great because then you can shorten it to your desired length) but after spending $25 for it, unless you can sew or don't mind an unfinished hem then you are looking at spending another $20 to get it hemmed, and that makes it an expensive dress.  I am 5'6" and these are long on me---about 2-3" longer than the floor!  But they are all purpose---you can dress them up or down.  I just love mine.  I wish they came in more colors, like white, and were hemmed. I've had mine a long time (like 2 years now) and they wash up well, no pilling and very little shrinkage or fading.  I am normally a size 6 (busty 36" so trending towards an 8, not a 4!) and the medium is perfect for me, not too tight.  If you are a smallish 6 or a 4, then go for the small size.

I also had to cut about 2 inches off the bottom as once it stretched out I would end up accidenally stepping on it even though I am 5'8 but for a 30 dollar dress it is a great addition to the wardrobe...looks great with converse too	olivia love	Size: X-Large|Color: Eco True Black	B00EO8DQNW	/gp/pdp/profile/A1YEUCICIL6A03/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/06/29
B005SG0GYG	it looks nice, it is a little too long for me ...	This dress is not worth $32. It fits, it looks nice, it is a little too long for me but I always have problems with that. I return it because it is super thin and on the right strap, it already bulges. It looks like one of those you throw in the washer and it comes out in a different shape. Now that I print the return label I see, that the shipping is on me, and a $1.50 restocking fee. I can get the same dress in one of those cheap clothing stores in Harlem for $15.

B005SG0GYG	My Favorite Dress	The UPS dropped off the package. I retrieved it off my porch, brought into my bedroom, opened it, took off the dress I was wearing and put on the black Alternative Women's Racerback Maxi Dress.I look divine in this dress. I'm wearing it now! Two days in a row. This has become my favorite dress. Why? I'm 5'9" so it makes me look long and lean. It hugs the body in all the right places. It's one of those dresses that make you look like no other.Now. I already have.... Let's see... one, two, three... 7 just like it that I bought over the years. Whenever I want to look perfect and feel comfortable and sexy carefree, I just put on one of these Maxi dresses and go! 5 stars all the way. Especially if you're tall!

B005SG0GYG	Hey, sexy lady	The bad: This is a looong dress. It's longer than Cake's Long Jacket. It might actually be 6' long.  Yes, the hem is unfinished and the fabric quality isn't the best, but it's recycled or something, so maybe it gets a pass. It also tends to get dragged down a little by its own weight and show a bit more cleavage.The good: This is the perfect, casual, "I just happen to be sexy" maxi dress. It clings to the right places, makes you look curvy and willowy, and oh, if only it came in better colors, I'd buy so many. Hide your heels under this thing, and the vamp factor goes up.

B005SG0GYG	Comfortable but too revealing	I ordered the grey one, like the model is wearing and it is very long on me! I'm 5'6 and 125 lbs and the neck comes all the way down PAST my cleavage. The side openings come down past my bra and the hem drags at least an inch on the floor. I think the body of the dress fits me well so if I order a smaller size it'd be too tight. Since I wear a headscarf the issues of an extremely low neckline aren't too much a problem. I also bring up the neckline a bit with a safety pin so it isn't hanging off my chest. That is the only way it can look the way it's pictured. Some things I do like about this dress are that it's a soft fabric and it doesn't wrinkle. Since the fabric is light, it does not hide much of what's underneath. Keep this in mind if you are self-conscious about your body or do not want to be worried about imperfections while wearing it. Despite all this, I do like actually like this dress and wear it often.	D.E.	Size: Small|Color: Eco Grey	B005SG0H68	/gp/pdp/profile/AG4IRYG4VIR43/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2015/10/07

It's definitely not a regular fit size! !!it's for really  tall people and even if I got S wouldn't change the fact of the proportions for hight . It's just for very tall. It's also  dragging to the floor. Color I like, material is OK (not super  but ok) , soft, easy on body  but  seethru kind of. Not sure send it back or just  donate it. It's not possible to wearing this dress as it is. It's need a lot of alteration! Not recommended it! Never had problem like this before.

I really expected a different type of material, I ordered an XS for I'm 5'2, 110lbs and I found the dress to be rather large for an XS I had to take the dress to be altered and now it fits just right.

I wear it all the time and throw it in the washer and dryer and it's still perf.  Wish I had ten.  Someone mentioned that the hem is unfinished, which still looks good, and would allow you to shorten if necessary.  Maxi dresses that are even slightly see through between the thighs drive me nuts, but this one is not see through at all.  I'm 5'7" with a long skinny torso, 34B-cup, and short muscular legs--the XS is perfect, no need to cut, but would be a scoch short if you have longer legs and want to wear with high heels.

B005SG0GYG	Careful around those curves!	I bought this dress for my wife, it is very sexy and form fitting. She is 5'3", 125lbs, with 36dd's. This dress does a great job accensuating her bust, hips and butt, the only problem is that it is very long. Even with heels on, a couple inches of the dress are draped on the floor. I guess I would think that with a size small, it would be a little shorter, but what do I know?  Unless you are 5'5" or taller, you might need to be prepared to hem the bottom up a little. That is the ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Other than that, it is very sexy, and is very complimenting for a woman with curves.	Charles A.

B005SG0GYG	flattering fit and only slightly transparent	I'm happy with the fabric, fit and style of this casual maxi dress. My boyfriend said it's seethrough when I tried it on, but it's not as bad as others that I have. This type of lightweight fabric will always et some light shine through. Since this dressfits away from your body in the skirt, it's not going to be as obviously transparent as more form fitting dresses. It looks like the photo and is true to description!	leatheraddict	Size: Small|Color: Eco True Black	B00EO8HSJ0	/gp/pdp/profile/A38E8VGPDW5WLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2015/04/06

B005SG0GYG	Cheaper on Amazon, but still not worth it.	I sought this dress out after seeing it for double the price on Zappos. Literally, it was twice as much. Seeing that Zappos was selling it for $68 I made the unfortunate assumption that it MUST be good quality. Well, we all know what happens when assumptions are made, right?!I am incredibly picky about fabric quality. And by “incredibly picky” I mean “For the LOVE OF COTTON! Why can’t anybody make a garment of medium weight fabric that doesn’t show everything?” There’s nothing I hate more than when you can see the perfect outline of my body through my dress because you can see the light between my legs. I feel like that’s a terrible way of describing it, but you get it, right? If I wanted to wear a bodysuit in public, I would. But nobody wants that.The straps are too long, the armholes gape, and the hem is unfinished. Is it comfortable? Sure. But I can go to Target and buy comfortable clothes from China for cheaper. I know what I want is out there, because I’ve purchased it. Last year I got an AMAZING dress by Alpine Design from Sports Authority, but it appears that they’re not continuing to make them. Had I known that it would be near impossible to find another solid color maxi dress that’s well made of quality fabrics, I would have bought out their entire stock.  The hunt continues. Recommendations welcome.	Leshell	Size: Medium|Color: Eco True Navy	B00BM82MNW	/gp/pdp/profile/A61Q78KR7X2SK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	15	1	2015/04/01

It shows a little more cleavage and side-boob than I am comfortable with so I wear a came top underneath. After washing on cold and air drying, the length actually shrunk. I am 5'5", and it went from skimming the floor to being about an inch off the floor. I like both lengths so that was fine. The top didn't shrink though. For reference, I am 130# and I bought the small. It is fitted through the mid section,  not tight anywhere else.

I'm a bit short 159 cm so the dress length surly is more than maxi to me,  the fabric is fine, finishing is OK ,  but it is not stitched from the feet side of the dress, I have to take it to a trailer to do that for me.The only thing that really made me unhappy about it,  is that they deducted it's price twice from my visa,  when I complained they(amazon costumer care) said it's the bank strategy and the money will be back in my Credit! But until now no one gave me back the money,  and for me I'm charged twice for it.	huda sammour	Size: Small|Color: Eco True Navy	B00BM82M00	/gp/pdp/profile/A2F3QO0IH39XU5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	3	2014/08/21

B005SG0GYG	Nice basic black maxi	The dress is very black (eco true black) and the material is a very nice weight. I didn't find it 'see-thru'...backlit by the sun certainly you could see outlines of my legs, but the skirt has some fullness to it so nothing to be overly concerned about. You can always wear a slip. I ordered a medium based on other size charts since I couldn't get the one for this dress to load, but a small would have been the correct size. The staps seem to be a bit long in the medium (for me anyway) and there is a bit of a fullness around the waist. It doesn't look bad, just had to keep hiking up the straps until I tied them up in the back as an emergency halter neck. The unfinished hem isn't even noticable. The length just hit the top of my foot with a flat sandal. I am 5'6", 127# , 36A, 29 waist, 36" hips (hopefully that helps someone choose the right size). I washed the top in hot water-got some wash out of the dye but not really fading of the dress. I did the bottom 1/3 in cool water hoping to prevent it shortening too much since the dress is 38% cotton. It didn't seem to shrink at all so I guess I should have exchanged it for a small if I wanted it to fit a little tighter. Good thing is no worries about undie lines with a medium. All in all, it is a very nice casual dress which dresses up nicely with a little shrug. I may order it in a different color and a small.	D.

B005SG0GYG	Great dress!	I randomly found this on Amazon and decided to order it and I love it!! I'm 5'5 and usually a size 12 and ordered a large and it fit perfectly.  It is very flattering and hugs in the right places, just loose enough around the tummy, but a nice fit on top and everywhere else.  A lot of reviews said this was super long, but I didn't think so.  I'm only 5'5 and it hit right at the ground which I like because I hate short maxis. Also, the unhemmed bottom is not bad at all, although the material is a little see-through when you're standing in the light, it's nothing a slip can't fit.  Awesome dress, great fit and it came really fast.	M.S.	Size: Large|Color: Eco True Black	B00EO8AWXO	/gp/pdp/profile/AYUKAO2ZMML2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2014/06/09

B005SG0GYG	Great, with adjustments	This is my first maxi dress and mostly, I love it. But that's after I: 1) chopped two or three inches off the bottom hem (easy to do because it's unfinished to start with and rolls up a little to hide scissor jags), and 2) sewed crude little folds into the tops of the shoulder straps. I'm 5'7", 145 pounds, 36B. Bought a medium. The arm holes were pretty gappy and it dragged too much on the floor before I did those things. But now I've got it on and it's soooo cute and comfy! I like the eco navy a bunch (it's as pictured), and I've come back to order eco black, in small. Seems like I've got enough room to try a small, and I'm slimming down for summer anyway. Hopefully I won't have as much work to do on the new one!	AnneEM	Size: Medium|Color: Eco True Navy	B00BM82MNW	/gp/pdp/profile/A305H3D68QC7HL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	17	4	2014/05/24

B005SG0GYG	WAAAAY TOO SMALL!	The 5 star rating is for the awesome customer service, I mean AWESOME!!  They promptly offered a refund due to the high shipping cost from US to China.  However, my suggestion is that the company include a US and European sizing chart to avoid all of this back and forth anyway.  Most Asians are smaller than most Americans and Europeans, and this dress is made in China.  It arrived with out tags of size, fabric/material, washing instructions.  It was like straight out of a ...... shop? I don't know, but the bigger issue is how tiny the dress is. I ordered a Women's size M and it looks more like an XS ( no exaggeration).  The customer service however, BLEW ME AWAY>  They were Sooooo nice to offer me a full refund for the trouble.  Thank you soooo much!

B005SG0GYG	Not Alternative Apparel Brand	Items ships from China, which is a red flag. Dress isn't even an actual "Alternative Apparel" name brand as described and pictured. Its not even close. I own the same  Alternative Apparel dress in another color, and this isn't even the same material. I'm absolutely amazed people haven't caught this discrepancy. The name brand tag on the dress doesn't even say "Alternative Apparel". I mean, c'mon, if your gonna try to pass something off as an original at least get the tag right. Only positive is seller refunded my money in whole when I complained and it was prompt, which is why I gave 2 stars.  They didn't even try to defend there product. Seller, please, please don't list this as Alternative Apparel brand, because it is not.	Paul Nichczynski	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A1NEHKY5WTU740/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	40	2	2014/05/17
B005SG0GYG	Inconsistent hem lengths among colors	Love these Alternative Apparel dresses, but I ordered both the eco navy and eco grey in Small, and they were different lengths. Unfortunately I didn't realize this until I tried on the navy and used that as a guide to cut both. I'm 5'5" and had to cut about 3" off the bottom of the navy, so it would hit the top of my foot, but when I cut the same off the grey it ended up above my ankle. My advice is definitely to try on and wash before altering the hem! Small fits great on me and I wear a size 4 in dresses.

Haven't owned a dress that was more flattering and made me look very feminine; I have a D chest and this dress makes me feel fantastic and is so comfortable!!! The dress sits about 1.5 inches off the ground or so while wearing flats. I am in love, it feels like it was made for me! I even paired it with a knotted button up and jewelry for my office job, I get compliments almost every time I wear it. Getting another one today!

B005SG0GYG	Surprised by the off sizing	I am 5'4" 120 lb-ish and a D cup.  I usually wear a size 2/4 or small so I just ordered the size I usually get with all my clothes.  The length was too long, I mean, even with heels.  I've got a nice "situation" on my chest and was shocked when the bust was waaaay too big for my ladies.  I'm constantly pulling it up and readjusting to prevent getting arrested for indecent exposure!  The material is jersey so it will pill with washing, but is nice for lazy days when I just want something to lounge in.  Warning--panty lines will show through this so wear a thong, sheer, or no panty line underwear with this.  It's also stretchy.  I am pregnant now and I have grown into it somewhat, but even with prego boobies, the bust is still too loose.  All of that aside, I still like it as a house dress and wear it often.

B005SG0GYG	Soft, Casual and Cute	The price was right so based on most of the reviews I decided to try it. Originally I planned to use this as a cover up for my swim suit but I also plan on wearing it around town in summer. Yes, the hem is unfinished at the bottom but doesn't bother me. I'm 5'7" and the length is just right - not too long or short. Will work with flip flops or flat sandals. I wasn't sure if the neck line would be too low for my taste but was glad to see that it's not. The fabric is soft but not too sheer or thin. I ordered the Eco Grey and it looks very similar in person compared with the photo.

And I wish I would have read the description better to realize it was an UNFINISHED HEM!!!! Who does that?  not only is it not worth spending extra money on to get it hemmed by a professional but its too expensive to return.  DON'T ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR!!!! The black doesn't even look like a black, more like a faded blackish grey or material that has been left out in the sun too long.

The material is thin, so the lighter colors may be a bit on the see through side, but I ordered it in black and I'm very happy!

B005SG0GYG	As expected but color different from expected	I agree with all other posts that the dress is long, but otherwise fits as expected.  My one slight disappointment was the color.  I thought it would be a light grey as in picture but it is more of a blue/grey.  I was hoping to use on safari for lounging around at night but not sure the color will be okay because of the blueish tint.

B005SG0GYG	Comfortable but will only last for one season.	The dress fit just as I expected it to. It hugs in all the right places. It's good to where for a casual outing and is very comfortable. The quality is not that good. Even when washed on a delicate cycle in cold water little lint ball appeared. I think after a few washes it will become a "lounge around the house dress only".

B005SG0GYG	simple and perfect!	I get more compliments when wearing this dress than when I wear any other type of dress.  It is so comfortable and perfectly fitting.

B005SG0GYG	Need to buy in every color	This is the second racer-back maxi dress I've purchased from this company. The fit and quality are as excellent as the first one I purchased. These are awesome. I'm 5' 8" and the hem just barely hits the floor, which is perfect. You can dress these up or down, and I find them perfect for beach vacations.	L. A.

B005SG0GYG	Better in person :)	I have been an Alternative Apparel fan for years now and am skeptical about sizes due to different fabrics/styles. I am 34C bust, 27" waist, 31" hips and about 5'6" and this in a Medium fit me perfect! Its quite soft as well and washes nice with only slight (and I mean slight) shrinking. It is long on me, but then again I like things kind of dragging on the floor. A Small would've fit fine to, but I love the way the Medium flows more on me (like the model in the picture). I bought the Eco grey and its exactly like it is in the picture. I am soooo glad I bought this dress! It'll definitely be my go-to Summer dress (I may just live in it;) ) Purchase it, you will NOT be disappointed!

B005SG0GYG	Super comfortable	This dress was just what I was looking for, an easy, cute and comfortable dress to throw on at the beach or wear for a day of sightseeing or even wear to dinner.I am only 5'1 and so this dress was super long for me, so beware if you are short then this dress will need to be altered for you.  However, it is super cute even on a short frame.	MG	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A26NSAEPTCBLJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2014/01/10

I'm 5,9" and 157lbs, I ordered the small based on other reviews and it fit perfectly, this dress just hovers over the floor. Its a bit sheer so be careful in sunlight. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because its not hemmed, but I plan to rock this dress still.	bella	Size: Small|Color: Eco True Navy	B00BM82M00	/gp/pdp/profile/A3SGTSOJEBVFY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2013/11/19

B005SG0GYG	Very casual......	For the price, this is a comfy garment to lounge around the house.  A bit too open under arms, though could work with something underneath. Could be a bit more generous around midsection.  If you're a stick with a flat stomach, it'll work for you.The fabric is lightweight-great for the summer. Generous length which may necessitate tailoring if you are under 5'5".	lois zagha	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A3KE8HOMO142TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2013/08/21

B005SG0GYG	Careful on fit	I have found that I love maxi dresses as part of my office wear.  This dress has a very nice feel, and I love the tank look in the back. My only issue is, and this is so weird cuz it's usually the other way around, it's actually slightly larger in the fit than what I would classify as "medium." But I wear a sleeveless shirt on the top, knot it in the front, and then it's difficult to see how the slight bagginess under the arms.  I would definitely buy this maxi again in another color, but I'm going to try "small" the next time.

B005SG0GYG	Not sure about fabric quality	I like the fit but the quality of this fabric is not great and I have doubts about it lasting very long. I have found that this is usually the case with Alternative Apparel, which is why I never pay full price for any of their stuff. The black looks like a really dark grey now that it's been washed once on delicate and line-dried. The grey one I purchased had some pilling going on, but again, I've only washed them once. It's not terrible for the price, but this is definitely a one season sort of casual dress.	LadyS	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A29OABXZHFBMFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	3	2013/07/19
B005SG0GYG	Nice dress but material is thin	I am about 5'5'', curvy with a D cup.  The dress fit well.  A little long so I wore it with a wedge heel. I am over all happy with the dress however the material is thin.  This dress will not take kindly to being stretched.  On me, it gathered at the lower back.  This would cause the area under the arms to gather as well.  I found myself constantly readjusting this and pulling the bust area up so I would show too much of the girls....  It's a nice casual dress to run errands in.	christy	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A2QY7KQV8AN0XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2013/07/12
B005SG0GYG	Cute and comfy	When I originally received my order, the wrong product was in the package, but I called the 800# enclosed in the package and they emailed me a return shipping label within ten minutes.  I taped the original packing up, dropped it in a mailbox (that's right - the mail instead of having to go to a UPS store - I loved that convenience!) the same day and had the right item within a week.This dress is a light, stretchy t-shirt material with a nice, raw edge.  The raw edge doesn't look sloppy - it's cute and casual.  It's just a very easy piece to put on and feel pulled together without having to put too much thought into your outfit.  I have to wear a heel because of the length, but I like the longer look.	mom-shopper	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A3H241YYOSKRDP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2013/07/02

B005SG0GYG	So comfy	I really like this dress, I'll probably order more in different colors. Very flattering. I bought a small and it fits perfectly. I am about 5'7" and I can wear flipflops with the dress and the hemline doesn't drag on the floor. I also have an athletic build and am about 130lbs.

B005SG0GYG	Not the greatest	I have to say I was disappointed in the fit of this dress. The length is very long which for some may be great. I'm 5'7 and it drags the floor a lot. My main complaint is the size of the arm holes or length of the straps, however you look at it. The holes are very large. If I knew how to sew I could cut the straps, shorten them and resew them but that is not a project I will be taking on. The left strap on the black is not sewn straight either. (I ordered the black and the grey)  The material is also very very thin. I do not wear this out if my house. This is strictly a lounge around the house dress which is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1, it's good for when I get out of the pool and need something very lightweight to throw on. Should have returned it but didn't want to pay return shipping.	Nichol Bergen	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A2OAN57IZEVMO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	76	2	2013/06/11
B005SG0GYG	Perfect maxi dress	Could not be more happy! Fit is perfect. Slight A line, so it's faltering if you have some curves. I bought this in black and had no issues with it being too sheer. It is very long; I am 5'7/140lbs, purchased a medium and it hits the floor. I like having a bit extra so I can wear a wedge with it. Dress is easily hemmed if needed. Fabric is not heavy, but same as any cotton/spandex tank top fabric.I found this as a positive since I wanted to wear this at an outdoor summer event.	stephaniefreed	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/AW1YQ6SM5XUEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	5	2013/06/09

B005SG0GYG	fabric too heavy	I have this same dress in Medium and color grey. The Medium is a bit too loose on top and I thought the Small would fit better. This is not the case at all.The fabric is too heavy for the length of the dress and pulls the top part so far down it doesn't look good anymore. While at first it seemed like the Small exactly the same size as the Medium, it now even seems as if it's bigger. Doesn't make any sense.Since I'm at an APO, sending it back for a refund via USPS would be too costly so I'll have to spend even more money on getting it altered in the end.Not pleased at all.	mstadler	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A1LG5T2I15BR8N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	2	2013/04/15
B005SG0GYG	Finally!	Few things to point out about this dress..Material feels cheap-ish, but I don't mind because I have been searching for a dress with this type of material as my "go to" dress, plus, it's really fresh..Another thing, I am 5'7, 135lbs with D chest, and the medium is perfect..Then length, AWESOME! I mean, finally a nice, truly long "maxi" dress..One thing that threw me off was that in the upper chest area, although it fits perfect, the arm hole part, looks a bit big..Imagine how a tank top looks when it fits big on you in the arms ..Other than that, I love this dress and I just may purchase more in other colors..I recommend..

B01MQV6YTS	The Fernleigh Track on a cold Autumn morning.	The Baleaf Men's Full Zip Long Sleeve Thermal Cycling Windproof Jacket, is great value for money. I am 5' 7", about 150 lbs, ordered a large size and it fits perfect. The quality of the Baleaf jacket fabric is very good and provides great protection from the wind and cold air. I am currently using the Baleaf men's jacket, together with a Spotti men's long or short sleeve cycling jersey, when I cycle along a bike track called, The Fernleigh Track, in Australia. (Google "Fernleigh Track", if you are interested to know more about it). Starting between 6AM and 7AM in the autumn mornings "DownUnder", can be quite cool and wearing the Baleaf jacket keeps my body warm. As my body starts to warm up, it is great to be able to unzip the Baleaf jacket to allow the surrounding cool air, to penetrate through the Spotti jersey, keeping my body cool. The three pockets at the back of the jacket are a great addition. I recommend buying the Baleaf men's jacket. Regards Stephen.

Hopefully that will be in an update soon.	steve2766	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2LQSGQYJLOOZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2017/07/27

B01J24C0TI	Surprised how much I've enjoyed it so far.	I have now had my Echo Show for two weeks, I wanted to play with it for a while before writing a review.  This is my 9th Echo device I've purchased and I'd say so far my favorite.  I placed it in the kitchen as that's where we seem to use the Echo the most.  I had to upgrade my Foscam to a Nest Cam to take advantage of some of the features. While some may not see the need to say "Alexa show the front yard" I really like that it pulls up the cam within a few seconds showing the walkway to my front door. I plan to upgrade my Skybell doorbell to the Ring for this same reason.  We've also used the screen to watch a recipe being put together on YouTube, great way to visually walk through step by step and not have to worry about getting your dirty fingers all over the iPad.  I also really like the feature that I can add pictures via Prime Photos and create a slideshow of my own pictures instead of a single picture or stock photos. My family has really enjoyed this feature as we've pulled pictures from years back and now get to enjoy them again.  One feature I wasn't sure I would care about but have come to enjoy is the lyrics showing up when you play music, sometimes those songs we never truly understood now all make sense!A couple of Features I'd like to see added/improved:Ability for the doorbell to ring automatically through the Show so you can see who is at the door without having to ask.Bloomsky to update their app to give you the ability to pull the device info on the screen w/out asking for it. Also would like to see it have the daily video show up.CNN, ESPN, and other update providers to have quick videos when you ask for an update.The long rumored/awaited Sonos connection which we're hearing is  a month or so away.

B01J24C0TI	Could be so much more.	You cant send youtube videos to it which was my main reason to get it. I wanted to watch some of the cooking channels I subscribe too. You can search but it wont give you the ones you want. Big miss there or maybe I just need to make an app for that. It does not allow communication with ring doorbell you can see but that not fully functional in my opinion. The Arlo that came with this does allow that. I also read reviews later that said they dont want this to be a tablet. But I expect this to be a tablet that I can speak to. A home hub needs to be at minimum have the functions of a tablet. Its like the traffic update. Really just time to work and that is it. Its cool to see the audible functionality and also the kindle reading that was surprising. The amazon music playing is cool with the lyrics. The amazon video is there also.

True, it's almost like all its good for is two-way with grandma and grandpa, close family, and friends...but dont' expect many of mine to shell out the $250 (w/tax) to have this luxury.  Of the 3,000 contacts between my wife and I,  about 10% own echos, 2 had a show and they were clients. Will wait till tech catches up, screen is bigger, and speakers fill the room.

B01J24C0TI	If you thought Alexa was useful before... just get one of these	I was already a fan of the Echo.  The whole family was really... My 3 year old just got super excited because Alexa finally understands when she tries to talk to her.  Adding a screen was the best thing that could've happened.  In the month we've had "new Alexa" in our kitchen ("old Alexa" moved up to the bedroom) we've already been loving the extra dimension the screen adds.  A few highlights:*  For those songs that aren't in Amazon prime that we're dying to hear, there's a great chance they're on YouTube, and the Show can now pull them up in a snap*  I was travelling on business last week, and used the Drop-in feature to visit with my wife and daughter when I had breaks in the day.  That alone made it worth the price.  A friend of mine bought one for himself plus 2 more for his parents and sister who live further away.  Now they can easily video chat.*  I was pleasantly surprised that it's smaller than I thought it looked in the pictures.  That makes it fit really well in a spot formerly occupied by a radio.The screen also adds lots of closed-captioning for music and news, and essentially makes a whole new batch of Alexa skills possible that weren't before.  Everything has been working as well as the original Echo so we're really happy with it.

B01J24C0TI	It is a very good device the Echo Show and it has some better ...	This was used to replace a Sony Dash that they bricked. It is a very good device the Echo Show and it has some better traits and some not as good traits as the device it replaced. I'm thinking that some of the things the other one did will be coming to the Show in the future. The show is very literal in what it hears and it takes getting used to which code words to do tasks. An example would be having it play some background music like a rain forest sound. You ask it to play rain forest sound and it tries to get albums by artist about rain forests instead of playing the skill sound. Speaking of Skills, that is what Amazon calls the things that Echo Show learns to feed you content. There are many of these skills and some might be a use as we move forward. I enabled a skill for that rain forest sound but it wouldn't play. The code word matters. Some are "Play" some are "Open" and then there are others. You would think a sound would play but in this case it is open. Other than that it is pretty accurate when you say something as long as it is clearly spoken. Overall it isn't perfect but it may get better. I like it for what it is even though there are some quirks in the interface.	Robert G.

B01J24C0TI	GREAT NEW ADDITION TO THE ECHO FAMILY	Great IA, more complete of the Echo items. The addition of a visual design feature makes this Amazon Echo a more informative (knowledge) device.

This alone helps in the knowledge of what the real words are and not ones that dad thought they were.  LOL.

B01J24C0TI	and I really enjoy it. I tend to be an electronics junkie	I've had my Echo Show for about 2 weeks now, and I really enjoy it. I tend to be an electronics junkie, and when I heard a new Echo was coming out, I had to have it! The sound quality is good and the video screen is a welcome addition. Much as I like it, however, we still haven't hooked up any smart devices that use video nor do we have relatives with an Echo Show to make video calls. This is an excellent product, but I would say that if you intend to use it mostly for music and other move conventional uses, the Show isn't really necessary. There a number of suggested videos that are fun to watch, but an upgrade wasn't really necessary for me. However, my wife has already made plans for me to hook up a front door camera and other things. So I am sure we will get full use out of the new Echo eventually.

B01J24C0TI	Could be promising in newer generations.	I bought this to replace the echo classic in my bedroom and move that along with my echo dot to other locations in the home.First if you're expecting a lightweight easily portable thin profile device, this is likely to disappoint. Personally I initially supported the low centre of gravity design. I had no intentions of it being portable and while I love my echo dot, I was pleased not to have to find a another speaker solution in a space limited area like a bedroom.  However I found the speaker to be only about 50% the quality of the echo classic.My biggest problems and the ultimate reason I'm returning it though is not because it's clearly a beta product that was rushed to market. I think I knew that going in and wanted to be on the ground floor anyway.  That said I can't keep the darn thing from going offline and flashing the red bar of death.  This might be slightly inconvenient if you have to say...use it as an alarm to be up for work. I worked with Amazon tech support for hours to solve the issue as I am not having the issue with any other mobile devices in my home including the other Amazon products. Amazons only solution was for me to drop most if not all firewalls on my secured wireless network. This would ultimately defeat the purpose of me using the Alexa interface as part of the automated home, especially the security systems and life support technology like climate and noxious gass sensers.It might be a cool novelty that I'm just being impatient with, but it's not for me right now.

B01J24C0TI	Great Device And Hub For My Smart Home Devices	While I'm a big Apple fan, their upcoming home pod was a big disappointment for me. Ugly, waaaaay overpriced, and focused on music? No thanks, I already have much better audio components already (Sonos). Meanwhile I'd been in love with my Amazon echo dot, and using it to integrate with my new smart home devices. When the show came out I was intrigued, and checked it out at an Amazon pop up store. I ended up buying it and I'm so glad I did! Now my smart home hub has a beautiful visual interface, great sound, calling ability, and an ever growing list of skills and device integration. Can't wait for the upcoming Sonos integration! When I saw the price, I thought 'maybe low res screen, and no touch screen functionality.' Actually the display is very clear and crisp, with touch screen. This is a great piece of tech and well worth the money!	PilotX	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A3NNUZYUVET4GR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/26

B01J24C0TI	I think it sucks!	I was not a fan. This was my first time trying an Amazon product of this caliber (never used the Echo before). I thought it was going to be Next Level, but it was behind the curve. I understand that with AI it has to get to know you and understand how you talk, etc. However, the learning curve should have been quicker in my opinion. I gave it about 3 weeks before I returned them (I ordered 2).Honestly, I use Google now and have Siri in the past. I like how when I ask a question, they can provide an answer. Alexa, told me, "Hmm I don't know about that" more than my wife. I had to put one of them out. Alexa had to go. My expectations were for it to be a competitor and that was not the case. Plus, I had to setup EVERYTHING. First, download the Echo app to your phone. Then add all the skills...programming it takes too long. You want games, download the skill. You want news; download the skilll. You want to play music; connect your account. You have more than one music account? Well, I will play the one I want, said Alexa.I asked Alexa to play a video and she could not find it. I was more specific with the next question asking to play the same video on YouTube and she played it. Alexa is not intuitive enough. We all have busy lives and I need the machine to just get it, and not have to be taught. Alexa needed too much attention from me and was not a good assistant. I found myself often referring back to saying Okay Google to my phone to get the answers I needed.Plus, this thing is slightly scary. Every question I asked it was on the app on my phone when I was not using my phone. And that drop-in feature; why would anybody want that who was not a stalker or concerned for an elderly parent? I often felt like I was being watched. I sure I am being watched anyway through various other means but it least they are more discreet about it. Overall, this piece of tech needs a revamp. Maybe Echo 2.0 will be more appealing to the masses.	AmazinG	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/AKF36SAISGA4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	2	2017/07/26

Couldn't do a lot of other things like connect to internet to show receipe for 'whatever"; you had to download all these 'apps'. Calling it something else doesn't make it anymore fun. Would do better to sync with a phone device so whatever was on your phone was automatically loaded to Echo. It wouldn't even sync  smoothly with my Arlo cameras which it said it would do. Camera views was frozen or never connected. And yes I have top of the line wifi router and separate modem. Returned both devices. One was for my kitchen 'helper' and the other for bedroom to monitor security cameras.	gvsandrs	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1XDP5451NX361/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	1	2017/07/26

B01J24C0TI	Thank You Amazon!  and my 95yr Mom Thanks you! (If she could).	I know that many media folks have stated that the "Drop-in" feature of the Echos is "creepy" and can see their point.  Here's a different perspective.  Mom is now almost 95 and she has short term memory dementia, she's in great spirits but I really can't teach her anything technical, like dialing a phone or even pressing a memory dial button.  She lives near my sister and is 2 hours away so visiting is always a bit of a project.I thought I'd try setting a Show next to her rocking chair.  I can now "Drop-in" on her every day and share some face time with her, visit with her grand daughter, see the dog whom she LOVES, and just make her smile.  The beauty is that there is no interaction needed on her end, the Caregivers and my Mom love this setup.  The fact that I can use my phone from anywhere and actually see and talk to Mom, and show her things  is hugely entertaining and comforting for Mom, and everyone in the family.So I say with extreme gratitude, Thank You Amazon for creating an amazingly personally helpful tool for the elderly.Personally I am enjoying all of the other great features of an Alexa with a screen, using her with my Arlo Cameras, etc. It truly is quite an amazing platform!  In my office I added a small Pioneer bookshelf stereo, I can be listening to Spotify, Pandora etc and say "Alexa, connect Bluetooth", the Pioneer stereo is Bluetooth enabled, it can be OFF and with that single voice command, the Show will wake up the Pioneer, and begin playing the sound over its speakers with no other intervention from me!  This is magical stuff!The only bug I have at the moment, "Alexa, turn off the screen", the screen turns off, then immediately turns back on.  Tell her again and the screen stays off, pretty consistent bug.	Ed Rempalski	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A1A5W6K4UNPFJH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2017/07/26

I Alexis, instead of Alexa.I loved watching and listening to content, reading books, etc. I have adult onset asthma. At first it was really rough, but I had been doing just fine. Then one night, I had a massive asthma attack. I could not move and could barely think. Alexa was playing a book in the background, so,in a whisper I asked Alexa to drop in on my daughter. She did and my daughter saw what was happening and was able to get to me and quickly administer the treatment I desperately needed. I did not want to write this in a review, but I feel that this "little" thing quite literally helped save my life.Thank you	BB	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AYCOLZ577P19U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2017/07/26

B01J24C0TI	Initial thoughts	Preordered 2 when they were announced. Overall it's a nice product. Much better speaker than the dot and nice and responsive touch screen. It's thicker than I thought it would be so fitting them on a small end table or night stand may create issues if you have other stuff like we do. For most people it's probably not worth the cost of around 3-4 echo dots. The dot does pretty much everything the show does (I had 6 dots) just no screen so while it's nice not really a need right now. The issue is unless friends and family also have the echo show you can't really use the video "drop in" feature that was a main featured selling point. Pains of being an early adopter I guess. I think with a few software tweaks it could and will be a lot more useful. Things like ringing your phone when you don't have the echo app open when someone calls from an echo device would be much more useful since I don't have echo app open usually. Also it would be great to be able to hang the device or having a removable camera so you can place it without having to move the whole unit around would allow you to use it as a baby monitor. Right now I don't know how you can as the camera is naturally positioned slightly upward due to the device being slightly tilted back when sitting on a flat surface. Anyways I'm sure it will get better but w/o that killer app/feature I would imagine that the dot which can do like 99% of the things that the show can for 1/4 the price is what most people will buy.Lastly Amazon if you're reading please don't forget about Alexa like Apple did with Siri (that's hard for me to admit being a huge Apple guy). Don't rely too much on 3rd party apps as she needs to continuously improve so she doesn't end up being useless.

B01J24C0TI	Works great --- other than call volume is so low you can barely hear it	Is nobody else having a problem with the call volume?We purchased an echo show for the drop-in purpose with an elderly family member.Only the drop-in feature (with video) is the exact reason we made this purchase.On the phone (App), we just cannot hear (voice call, video call and drop-in) between iPhone App and echo show.Just 2 ft away from the echo show, we can hear loud and clear on the echo show.But, on the phone, we barely hear what the other says into the echo show.After several contacts with Amazon helpdesk, we returned the first one and tried the replacement.The same thing is still occurring with the replacement hardware.Calls (voice, video and drop-in) between the App and echo show works, but you can't really hear what the echo show side is saying.  Putting your ear to the phone is the only way to get sufficient volume level.  What's the point of the video call, if you have to put your ear on the phone, showing your ear on the echo show screen?With voice-only calls, we tested several times on the speakerphone, sadly, the same - you can barely hear.The person we wanted to gift the echo show is not likely to yell all the time for the conversations.  She is more like a whispering, gentle old lady.We don't think we'll keep this, but we might to try the second replacement to see if that solves the issue.

B01J24C0TI	Nice addition to the alexa line.	I've had my show for about 3 weeks now.  Works great on the ring doorbell and arlo cameras. Short 7 seconds delay for ring (to log in).  Say Amazon(the wake word), show me the front door or Amazon, show me the backyard (for the arlo camera) -11 second delay) to show the cameras (of course, you have to rename the cameras appropriately.  I have 5 arlo cameras that work great with the echo show.  I am thinking of getting the ring floodlight to install on the garage door because the Echo show works great on it (plus it doesn't wear down the batteries as the arlo cameras does).  Ordering amazon by voice command is better...now that it has visual confirmation feedback.  Music sounds slightly better than the original echo (I haven't tried raising the volume greater than volume 6 for fear of causing my neighbor to complain as well as fear of damaging the speaker as I think a previous reviewer had commented).  It shows the current weather instead of just anouncing it plus it gives you the expected high/low for the current day as well as the 7 day forecast (it shows the next 4 days and either wait to see the next 3 days or you can just swipe right with your fingers.  By saying show me the movie showtimes, it shows a picture of movies currently showing in my area preceded by a number.  You then can press warch trailer or showtimes (if you press this, you get a bunch of theaters listed bt proximities to your location.  You select a theater, then it displays the upcoming showtimes).  I haven't tried the calling features, but I bet it is really neat (with someone who also has an echo show.  The only thing I dislike about it is it currently shows your calendar events where you can scroll through.  I wish it has the ability to show the current month with the current day highlighted.

B01J24C0TI	Okay - but gonna return it.	We (me) like to mess around with this techy stuff.  We have had the Echo for a few months, then go the SHOW.  It does have some bool things and but after a few issues and our 30 day return coming up this week, I think it is about to go back.1 - Got the Ring doorbell.  It will show, but there is a few second delay.  Reasonable and not a big issue, but an issue.2 - Got a EZVIZ camera. You have to link it, but will not show up. Alexa says she is getting camera, but it never shows. No answer from EZVIZ. Camera works fine on my iphone.3 - Drop in/calling.  Camera is worthless for seeing anything in the room.  It shows picture of celling.  If someone were standing directly in front of it, that would work.  But - checking on kids, elderly person etc would be challenging.	G.

B01J24C0TI	Eye of the Storm	This sleek device was essential this weekend.  My wife and I recently acquired a beach house.  Not only did it prove to be the center of conversation with a number of family and friends but having a screen to watch Amazon Prime Movies kept the two kids entertained as we haven't had an opportunity to get a TV.  When the children weren't watching; the adults had as much fun pumping the tunes (mostly reggae and beach themed music).As a side note suggested to a brother-in-law that our mother-in-law could benefit from an Echo as her fingers are gnarled with rheumatoid arthritis.  Being able to call out "call Donna" would provide a semblance of control and connection.Now I'm getting familiar with using the Show to slideshow pictures via Amazon Drive Storage.	timelordTourist	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A1LK8VQAXG7U1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/24

B01J24C0TI	I just don't understand how anyone can give this a bad review. This is such an incredible device	Not sure how to make this show as "verified purchase" when you get it from Prime Now but that's how I bought it.  I just don't understand how anyone can give this a bad review.  This is such an incredible device.  Like every Alexa device (and Google Home), you can speak and get it to play music, play radio stations, give you the news and weather.  But the screen adds a very useful bit of functionality.  For instance, the one thing Alexa always had that Google Home does not have is the ability to make and update a to-do list.  But with Echo show, you can ask her to show you your to-do list and up comes the list on screen. You can then say "delete number 4" or whatever.....and she zaps that item away.  Same stuff applies with making and keeping a shopping list.Throughout the day, Alexa alerts me to breaking news with headlines on the screen....including birthdays from my Facebook friends. Or announcements that I have a package coming in.The one complaint I've seen over and over, usually from people who haven't bought it, is that it looks clunky.  NO IT DOES NOT.  Place it on your desk or kitchen counter and it defaults to something that looks like a table-top clock....and it keeps the time and weather on the screen.  It actually looks very much like a futuristic time and weather device.....but hidden underneath is a world of power.  It's great and I'm glad I bought it.

B01J24C0TI	Video calls are the greatest!	Very nice device!  I purchased Echo Shoe becasue I have a leaning disabled son who lives in a home away form me.  I do not get to see him more than once every 6 weeks or so.  He would not be able to use a smartphone or a tablet.  So, the Echo show allows me to  make a video call and all he has do do is nothing (becasue I can use drop in) or just hit the green button.  It is easy for him to make a call just by saying, "Alexa call dad"  He has also learned to ask Alexa to play music.  The other features are not appropriate for him but the ability to make video calls is worth the money.  If I had a wish list it would include making the screen more moveable.  My son has not yet gotten used to the idea that he must be in a good position for me to see him.  The angle is not good while he is sitting by his desk.  If the screen could at least be moved up or down manually, that would make all the difference.	sad dad	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2Y2SLP9J9GXTJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/07/23

The only major disappointing thing about ECHO SHOW is that it is supposed to automatically turn off the screen when not in use, and then turn back on when you walk back into the room. IT DOES NOT DO THAT and the help desk was (is) not aware that it has this feature even though the ECHO SHOW instruction pamphlet that comes with the machine clearly depicts the feature in 'Interacting with your Echo Show' section. What?	Amazon Customer	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A20EUYJUX9DAGP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/07/23

B01J24C0TI	Work in progress, hoping it gets better	Needs more integrations and it needs to work better.  For example, I cannot seem to find a simple command for Echo to tell me what my Honeywell thermostat is set to,  I can change it up and down, it just won't report the current setting.  Also I have Shows in multiple homes, need a better way to delineate which devices go with which location.  For example, when in location "1" and I want to change the temperature, it should default to the thermostat co=located with the Show device I am speaking to.  Then it could require more specific instructions if I want to change the thermostat in the other location.Also, integration with Ring cameras is sporadic at best.  Sometime it shows them, sometimes it doesn't, even when the Ring App itself is able to show them.In addition, I would expect to be able to have more customization available for the Home Screen such as showing the current date along with weather conditions and forecast.  It is a "Show".It's a lot of money to spend for an alarm clock and shopping list manager.

B01J24C0TI	Disappointing and not very useful.	It's alright. I tried to justify its existence based on what I've been using it for and it just isn't doing much. You can't ask it any actual questions. For example, I asked Alexa "what is Sade's birthday" I got a month and a day with no year. I asked Google the same and got year month and day. I asked Alexa "what is the big three upgrade" and it told me some BS about the constitution when it has to do with car audio. So far, all I have been able to do with this thing is play music from YouTube because Alexa doesn't seem to know or have any of the music I want to hear. Watch YouTube videos, set alarms, and video chat. I can literally do all of those with my phone no problem so what is the actual purpose behind having a product this expensive that does stuff I can already do? If Google puts out a similar product to this, it's a wrap for Alexa.	Jonathan C.

Received the Echo Show as a Father's Day gift so we could share f2f communications with our 5 month old granddaughter. The "Show" looks good has great sound and excellent screen resolution. It will NOT import my entire contact list and we can NOT  initiate a video call.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED 😔	James P.

At other times it will not respond to any commands and must be shutdown and restarted.  Disappointed and the inclusion of a printed manual or dedicated online web site with FAQs and troubleshooting tips would have greatly improved to me.  Now I must use a cell phone to access a 3rd party manual and it is for Echo with no dedicated manual for Echo SHOW	Joseph D.

B01J24C0TI	Nice, but some major security holes	Really the nicest of the Amazon Alexa devices, but huge security holes, especially on the display where it places all kinds of info: my calendar appointments especially. All guests visiting can simply stand and read any of these devices in the house. Imagine the chaos if this was in a law office, a politicians office, even a doctor/dentist, social worker, the list goes on. It breaches client confidentiality.Customizing the screen is it's worst feature. I am scared to turn on the calling feature also as apparently all my echo devices will ring no matter who phones me. A major breach of security. There seems to be no way to allow only certain callers in your phones contact list to be permitted... it's all or none! And anyone in the house can easily answer a call as who knows who the call is for? This seems to be true for all Alexa devices. Maybe someone that is actually daring to try the calling features can amplify on this.

B01J24C0TI	But if you have other smart home devices	It does what is claimed.Not everyone will want a Show or any type of Echo for that matter.  But if you have other smart home devices, the Echo Show is a great way to integrate them.  Especially if you have security cameras, Show provides useful functionality at only a marginally greater cost than the screenless Echo.  I'm using it more often and for more things than I thought I would.Comprehension is not as good as the Google Home but integration with other devices is superior.  Depending on a household's needs, one or the other may be the best choice.  If Amazon can bring contextual awareness up to the level of Google Home, it would be the hands-down winner.  But even without that, many will find it a useful home addition.	Robert F.

B01J24C0TI	Except for that, Mrs.  Lincoln... how did you like the Show	I have 4 echos - echo, tap, and dot.  I like them and use them a lot.  Well designed, perform well.  Trying the Show was a "why not?The "Show stopper" for me was the constant stream of on-screen notifications and ads.  Looked for ways to turn it off or, at the least, customize it  No can do.  Other users have mentioned things that sorta, kinda, shut down the screen but... not for long.  Nothing worked for me.  It comes back jabbering at you whether you want it or not.I returned it.  Got Amazon's usual good service on the return.Other characteristics:.  The screen is bright, clear.  Feels small.  To me an "echo with screen" goes against what echo is.  You talk to and listen to it.  Don't need to look at it.  That's the real strength of what it is.  In my opinion.

B01J24C0TI	Great Potential	Setup is a breeze. The speakers sound much better than I anticipated. I think most folks will struggle to find a handy, comprehensive list of commands. There are far too many reference sources that offer a bunch of nonsensical suggestions. Thus far; I'm enjoying the ability to use Show for music, as a security monitor when I'm away from home and as a source of information. If you're thoroughly invested in Amazon services (as I am), you'll find a much greater use for this product. I particularly like the rotating feed of news headlines. Thankfully; they consist of more than the usual political stupidity. I've viewed some YouTube videos, sampled off beat new stories and tested the ability to scan product barcodes. I do have a want list (as I do with most any product): stopwatch functionality (different from timers), heat index readings when requesting current weather conditions, the ability to identify unknown songs playing from other sources (movies on TV).

The pair have completely replaced our home intercom. Now we just drop in on the kids playing upstairs -or set timers or alarms for them get on the bus or get in bed. They watch Amazon Kid shows on it when the adults are occupying the TV.  Most mornings we have music playing during breakfast. It really has become a central piece in our tech friendly home.

B01J24C0TI	Great for seniors	Bought two Shows - one for me and one for my 78 year old mom. The Show has been an amazing experience for her. She calls us from her room through voice activated commands with Alexa. We are able to 'drop in" on her without her having to fumble around for her phone or anything. We video conference this way a couple of times a day, and it's done wonders for her spirit. She's able to video conference from her show to our smart phone. She is thankful for little things using Alexa like asking what time it is without having to get up out of bed. She's lost some mobility due to a stroke, so anything that makes her life easier is worth it to me. If you have a senior in your life and are on the fence about the Show, I highly recommend getting one. It's made a difference in her life.	George M.

B01J24C0TI	Definitely a "GO FOR IT" !!!	I have, the Google Home device, the Amazon Echo, and now the Echo Show. The Amazon device, Alexa, listens way better than Google, has more integrations with my house devices (I have a Z-Wave controller, the Nexia) and differently from Google,  Alexa is able to control my lights. Both can control my Nest thermostat easily. Google searches better (probably because it's Google powered) and give better traffic and route  updates. But daily I use the Echo devices much more often than Google (that I use mostly to play music) . The Echos are perfect for managing your shopping list, you agenda, I can even see my cameras on it and the video calls are perfect and really nice. I'm really in to this kind of stuff. But if I could only choose one I DEFINITELY would choose the Amazon Echo Show. Does not get a five stars due to the price and because these things are always improving. Great Device.	Cesar R.

B01J24C0TI	Next	The must-have device  for any consumer who wants to talk to an inept phone tree, but cannot be bothered to call Comcast. This device is good for making calls, if by that you mean that the voice controls are "called in." This blurb under the text box here gives review guidlines so let's do this by the numbers:"Do explain why you liked or disliked it:"Alexa is Suri on about 5 fewer lead paint chips. This would not be so bad if there was a way to cut it off and start again quickly, unfortunately there are frequent times where you spend more time trying to get her to finish the wrong task she decided till you can try again, than it would to just about anything wipe off your hands, get to a computer, complete the NY Times Sunday Crossword. Then when you try again what of the mutitudes of things that might theoretically be the culpret, a fan, kid in the other room, music, Gremlins on holiday from tearing wings off airplanes. So based on such little useful information your solution is to try again after calling to the other room to quiet the kids, turn off the overhead fan, avoiding ladders and stepping on cracks and maybe.. maybe you might get a useful reply or you can truly begin to discover precisely why "the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result."I kid you not one of the promotional materials said something like "Alexa show me eggs" or something like that and it comes back with nothing I had multiple people say the very line that was used as a example by Amazon's promotional materials all of us came back with nothing. Why they would have a command for "show me eggs". Oddly enough unlike "Show me eggs" which is as I said given as a example "Alexa show me my video library" does not seem to be a recognized command while being far more sensible... but again its not like it got the answer to the one that was listed but it seems sensible to ask a echo show but it instead gave me local listings for public libraries."Do compare to similar products or services and share how long you've used this product."For calls it loses out to cell phones, landlines, skype, and carrier pigeons. It is odd for example that in the age of everyone having their own line and family cell plans they would go with the single account=single line approach. Conceptually it seems a bit regressive but if that's the niche they can bring back the "party line" with the 2.0 the 3.0 they can just re-brand that carrier pigeon and call it their "Alexa Drone." I think that one would be hailed as the best one to date because it knows 1 command really well "find your home". It may crap on you like the earlier models but at least it gets the task right.You might not have expected a full on "Jeeves" like experience but you will be disappointed that your digital assistant is "Wooster" in the first act."Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations."The best thing about this Amazon product is the Amazon return policy. All product gripes aside their return process is pretty painless at least at the time of this writing."Don't include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation."Even if that hat tip to their return policy qualifies on some level as "promotion" I think they will let it slide, but rest assured dear reader I am not being paid for this review.

B01J24C0TI	Love love love.	Our other echo went out and we had to have another one. Decided to spend the extra money for the Echo Show. Well worth it. We already have cameras hooked up through the show and the screen makes the whole Alexa experience even better. Takes things to the next level. Really awesome.	Chad B.

B01J24C0TI	Love it!	I love the Echo Show!- It sounds great.- It can find so much information.- It shows lyrics to a lot of songs.- There's just too many awesome things to list.Con's:- Has to be plugged in at all times. Would be Nice if it could be Battery Powered in addition to being plugged in.- Has to be connected to WiFi to work. Would be nice to be able to use it where I don't have access to wifi like Siri (iPhone) can.- I don't like that my information and everything I do on it (video chats, my voice, etc.) are all saved forever. That creeps me out cause it's a security issue. Definitely think that they should not store anything about me.

B01J24C0TI	Didn't think I would like it initially	I had an Amazon Echo and a Google Home before this. My most recent was a Google Home. The Google Home had too many issues and was not consistent. Also, my Hue lights would not work consistently so, after using the Google Home for a month, I decided to go back to Amazon Echo.Initially, when I first heard they released the product, I figured they were “reaching” in terms of a product rollout. Then I started to see the reviews on Youtube and started getting interested and my thought of Amazon “reaching” was starting to go away.The Amazon Show is more useful than I thought. Having the screen is a great thing if you like to see things visually. For example, when you want to see how much time is left on the timer, what is on your grocery list, a scrolling feed of top news stories or the weather and time. In terms of watching videos and such, the screen is about the same size as the Iphone 7 Plus or Galaxy S8+.Overall, comparing it to the Echo, I think the $50 extra for the display is worth the money. While I do not use the video screen all the time, its useful to have when you want to see something visually.	techfan	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A3JN8DMA0EC9YL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/21

It partly makes your house automated. He has added light bulbs so now he turns on & off lights just by telling Alexa. We make phone calls, check the weather anywhere. There is so much Alexa does & even more updates coming that will allow her to do more.So glad we bought 2, one for upstairs & one for downstairs.

B01J24C0TI	Not Quite There Yet	This product is great if you have a lot of compatible devices for your home or order a lot of repeat items from Amazon.  But unless your content getting scores or traffic updates from the internet, you may be a little disappointed with its capabilities.  I have to admit..  I DID NOT research this product before I bought it (unusual for me) and simply relied on the advertising.  That was a mistake.  I got a chance to borrow a Google Home unit to compare it to and after much frustration with Alexa - I returned both my Echo Shows for a Google home unit.  Until Alexa can actually search and process internet results - like the Google Product (and the soon to be released Apple) - its usefulness is limited and not for me.

B01J24C0TI	Excitement turned to disappointment	I have each and every Amazon device (Ok not the phone). Tap, Dot, Echo, FIre, Fire TV, Kindle and now Show!!! I was looking forward to this device but was thoroughly disappointed.Cons:1. The screen is almost 30% smaller than ipad mini.2. So so screen resolution at best.3. Cannot play youtube or netflix easily. Amazon wants you to use their prime service only.4. Biggest disappointment..poor sound. No where near Echo- the deep base and 360 degree sound that echo produced. Show is average.5. No good screen saver (or have rolling picture slide show). That too the slide show does not loop well.Pros:1. Can see the time and weather.2. Facetime like calling feature is good.Lots of improvement needed. NOT worth the price. Stick to Echo for now!!!

B01J24C0TI	The Echo Show is worth checking out	First of all I would like to mention I did not purchase this from Amazon. It was an impulse buy at Best Buy while going to buy an additional wemo plug. I would have to somewhat compare this to an old Sony Dash but with more capabilities. Back a few years Sony came out with a product called the dash. It was a great addition to my kitchen but then they dropped all support and essentially bricked it. I have been looking for a replacement for years but could find nothing that came close. Then along comes the Echo Show. A device that is shaped and had everything I loved about the short lived Sony dash but with the addition of having Alexa and some other nice features like not having to leave the kitchen when cooking to view my Arlo camera feeds. So now I think ok I am liking this although I do wish it was a bit more compact. The setup was a quick painless process unlike some other devices I've recently purchased. Speaker quality is better then the original Echo, and defiantly better then a dot or tap. I also find it a bit creepy that it knows when your in the room or not. It goes to a black screen with a clock when it doesnt detect you through the camera and when it does it returns to the "home screen". I also like how you can customize the background on the home screen. I find that it has trouble hearing me when my window a/c unit is on or a fan is on in the same room so that could use some improvement there. I would probably buy another one for the basement at some point. I think the positives overweigh the negatives with this unit.

B01J24C0TI	Not a fan of the show. At. All.	I love the echo family...I have a dot or an original echo in just about every room (even the bathrooms). I use echoes to control all of my lights, TVs, thermostats, etc. However, the show is just not a device that seems ready to me.So where do I begin? Well, I will just list some of the issues:Visual privacy, drop in is optional, but not welcomeSpeaker isn't good, the dots have better speakersEven at max, volume is still too lowNo 360 sound, you have to be in front of the device to often hear the responseBland/lifeless visuals, not a great touch interfaceDesign is not very attractive - it's really bulky for what it is and if it were beige, it would easily be straight out of 1983This show is getting returned.

B01J24C0TI	Amazon Support for the Alexa not up to par on this device	At 1st I wanted to give this device 5 stars. After having for slightly over a week, I've run into a problem with the Alexa SiriusXM skill. I have an account with full access on Sirius that includes full computer/device access. I've add the this option to Alexa and Alexa tells me it's linked. I ask her to play something like 80's on 8 and she tells me my subscription doesn't cover that. So I ask her just to play ch8. Then she tells me "something is wrong" but she won't say what. I've spent a good deal of time with Sirius making sure it's not their issue. I've spend just as much time with Alexa support on Tuesday. I was told it was being sent to the development team, and that I would be contacted back within 24 to 48 hours. Now 36 house later, still no contact as I was promised by the person helping me Tuesday. I've never had problems with any of my previous Amazon devices, but this one is a challenge. I feel that I upgraded my Sirius subscription for nothing as I can't use it on Alexa as I had expected. Also please note, I have the original Echo and an Echo Dot and they can't play Sirius either.

He and Alexa are good pals now.The voice recognition is still a bit off and when I pull it up on m phone app, I get the giggles at how many ways I ask Alexa a questions and she still doesn't get sometimes easy obvious things	Oz	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2XB1NA6YHPYA9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/21
B01J24C0TI	Good but needs work	My echo dots are highly responsive and they hear the name Alexa every time I say it.  I use the name echo on the echo show to differentiate it from my echo dots. I've found that I have to say echo loudly, and sometimes I have to say it multiple times for the unit to respond.Why doesn't the screen automatically turn off after a period of time? Nobody wants to have their devices burning up electricity when they're not even home. Dumb. I have used the command "screen off".  It works but only occasionally. It seems to only work after no command has been said for a few minutes. However, if you communicate  with the device, and then tell it to turn off the screen, it comes back saying  that it doesn't understand that command.  Perhaps this is a bug, and the type of problems that early adopters like myself run into. However, it seems like something as simple as having the screen turn off automatically after a period of time would be something that would automatically be built into the product.  Displaying my photos is problematic unless I specifically ask to see my folders first.  Finding and playing content from my Amazon prime account is an awkward task to say the least. The lack of specific help on Amazon's website is  both surprising and disappointing to me.  Why is it that I can add items to my Amazon shopping list via the echo show, but if I tell it to remove something I am instructed to go to the Amazon Alexa app.  If I am forced to use the app, then why do I need a voice product?  Why is it that an interactive product  such as the Echo show  can't give me answers to help related questions?

B01J24C0TI	If you want one of these things, wait till they get all the bugs worked out	I know it is new, but I don't see the point of having this. It doesn't really add features (other than the "look at the new toy I have") It actually works worse than the original echo.Example: Listening to a playlist on Spotify. In the past I could say "next song" and it skips. The Echo show has no idea what to do with that command.orIt constantly scrolls thru news feeds on the screen. One of the items interested me, but all I could do is ask Alexa for top stories, then use the touch screen so it could have issues displaying the article. I had to use a laptop if I wanted to know more.orI have one on my bedside table. The screen is bright, and I know there is a command to make it go black. When I say "Alex screen off," it asks for which device I want, and I have it named "Master Show". It says it can't find that device.If you want one of these, look hard at if you are good with a regular echo. The cost is more than an echo, but the speakers are worse.

B01J24C0TI	Has potential, but too many negatives, returned mine and second to be used as a gift	Has potential but not worth the extra cost.  Low quality speaker compared to the original Echo.  I wanted mainly for viewing lyrics and managing my calendar/tasks.  It is nice that you can edit tasks and remove tasks which you cannot do without the touch screen or phone app.  Smaller screen than I was imagining, too small to watch videos. NO Bluetooth or audio output jack. Swipe menu from the top is nice for selecting the next song changing volume.  Overall, may be improved but I am at a sweet spot with 2 echo dots, a bluetooth speaker and 2 full echos.	azreader	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A35N0VYLJXUXR7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/07/21
B01J24C0TI	NOT what I expected	I have embraced Alexa and have several dots placed throughout the house.  From almost every corner Alexa can hear me and she respond appropriately.  Almost every light in the house is connected to her and I love the functionality.  I pre-ordered the Echo Show about a month before it came out and I am disappointed.  Partly my fault for expecting more and partly an inferior product in my opinion.The screen works as advertised however the touch functionality does not seem to be as responsive as a phone or tablet.  This could just be me but it doesn't seem to take inputs very well.The speakers sound ok but don't hold a candle to a dedicated Bluetooth speaker you could pickup for $40 (generic) to $79 for a Bose Soundlink.The microphones do not seem to work very well.  I have the cheaper Dots and they work much better.  I have the Show in my kitchen and when I ask Alexa to start a timer (she is 5 ft away) 4 times out of 5 the Show does not pickup the voice command and my Dot in the other room 30 ft away does.I was expecting a fully functional Fire tablet with a built in speaker and 7 microphones with Alexa highlighted as the center Jewel.  The show is NOT what I expected.  It is literally the brains and power of a Dot with a screen that displays SOME information.  Yes you can see the words to songs but amazon charges a premium for this service---No thanks.  I really wish this was a fully functional android system (more specifically overlaid with Amazon's fire ecosystem) so I could check emails, view my full calendar, make adjustments to my calendar by voice, manage multiple apps and grocery lists, etc etc.The good:-Well built-Alexa is in there-Yes the Show is a screen, speaker, and far-field microphones all wrapped into oneThe Bad:-VERY limited functionality using the screen-Microphones do not work half as well as those on the $39-$49 Dot-Bulky for what it is-Not much benefit over other Alexa modelsTo be fair I have not reached out to Amazon yet to see if my unit isn't working properly in regards to the microphones NOT picking up my voice when I'm in the room near the device.I would recommend passing on this device at the current price of $229.  In my opinion the unit is worth $129-$149 when you consider you can get a more functional Fire tablet for $49-$79 depending on size/specs.I would recommend buying an echo Dot and Bose soundlink along with a fire tablet.  Mount the tablet to the wall and have the Dot sitting next to it.  This setup would cost slightly less than the show and you will have better sound, Better microphones, and a fully functional touchscreen for every task chore, video, music, recipe viewing, calendar, note, website to browse etc etc.  From what I understand the new tablet responds to voice anyways so maybe the dot is overkill just get the tablet and connect it to a speaker and you will have a much more functional unit for half the price.

B01J24C0TI	A good device. May be more useful in the future.	Pretty good product. But not offering so much that is new or useful yet. Don't get me wrong I love the Alexa cloud service and have dots and the original echo in my home too. I hope they keep updating because at this point I don't find myself really drawn to using the show over the other products. The video features are not that appealing and I don't think I will be using the video calling as other tools are better and don't require others to have this set up in their home or phone. So it's a nice toy at this point but not a game changer. If it becomes a smart home hub in the future I might be singing a different tune at that point. If you are looking for an initial alexa device and are willing to spend the money, I would go with this because the extra features and the speakers are quite good in this device. If you have echos or dots and are on the fence, you won't be missing too much by holding off in my opinion.	J.D.

B01J24C0TI	Oh Alexa how I love thee, let me count the ways	So I was already a fan of the Echo and used my regular Echo all the time, in fact, several times during the day.  When I saw Amazon was going to come out with the Echo Show, I knew I was already onboard so I preordered the Show.  I have to tell you, there are many times we make a purchase and within a few days we regret our decision.. or we may not really regret our decision, but find the product we purchased does not have as big an impact as we thought it would.  This is certainly NOT the case with the Echo Show. as with my regular Echo, from the moment I wake up and all day long I use the echo. Asking what is the weather going to be like today (so I can decide how to dress) What is on my calendar (to decide if I have to wear a suit and tie), I ask it for my flash news briefing and get the news from sources I frequently go to. When I get home, I ask Alexa to adjust the air conditioner and lighting to my liking and even ask for smooth jazz to help me unwind my day (oh yea so with songs with lyrics, it shows you the words, kind of like karioki). If I need some quick ideas on what to make for dinner, Echo is right there and ready to go!  Finally, for the times I forgot if I locked the car door on my Benz, I can ask Alexa to lock the car doors or if I want to go out and want to restart the car, I can do that too!  All in all, the Echo Show lives up to all the hype and more!	Michael	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AQS9A9XZODEOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2017/07/20

However I think the the original "cylindrical" Alexa had better sound. The "Show" seems to me to be more one directional, whereas the original was more omnidirectional.I do like that I can talk with my sister face to face. Like I said, I guess I'm still in the "Getting used to it phase". I think as time goes, I'll like it more and more.

B01J24C0TI	Amazon Show is not ready to buy and usr	Dont buy. Really not ready . Dont waste you money, im a high tech person and early adopter. Amazon HAD great products. The show is a no show.  My sister and i bought one and spent hours and hours later we cant connect. We tried everything. I have an alexa echo and many smart iot connects to many smart switches and Hue. Not "show" it cant connect with anything except old wemo devices.As i mentioned this is a field i have expertise in, i am shocked amazon is selling this.Also, dont expect the show to hear you, it requires saying things over and over again.I think what amazon has done is to not connect the connected home, it takes us backwards.If you want almost all the workable finctionality, order echo dot.

B01J24C0TI	OK, but not a huge benefit upgrade yet from non-screen Alexa devices.	Device still seems to be a work in progress. Significant delay in displaying home monitoring camera video (both to load and then the actual stream is delayed). I purchased this to have a dedicated display for my home monitoring cameras because of the delay, it doesn't serve this purpose very well. The screen is a nice touch when listening to music to see who the artist is, but otherwise seems under-utilized and is always on showing tips and prodding you to do things, which I find annoying. Would be nice if you could customize what's on your home screen.	KR	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A1WW1QMFHIDX5J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	3	2017/07/19

B01J24C0TI	Hopeful That Tweaks Are On The Way	Overall like the unit.  Definitely do not like the "drivel factor".  Figured out how to turn off the drivel headlines about the latest celebrity announcements.  Disappointed that I am not able to disable the visually intrusive and unhelpful "things to try".  Less is more on the home screen, especially when the unit is located in an area with high visibility.  There's a "cool factor" in owning and learning to use the Echo Show that is greatly diminished by the "drivel factor" that infers to everyone in view that you actually care enough to choose to have these elements on a home screen.  Looking forward to the integration with Sonos that is apparently on the 2017 horizon, making the unit even more useful in our home.	M.

B01J24C0TI	What to do with that display?	I was an early adopter of the original Echo.  I have an Echo Dot too.  So when I saw the Echo Show, I was all ready to dive in.  I was really looking for a new nightstand smart clock; I've had a Sony Dash for years and still consider it the best clock I've ever owned.  The Show has promise.  The speakers inside the unit are nice, and they will fill a room with sound.  The display is bright enough during the daylight hours, and it will adjust in brightness as the ambient light in the room changes (though it does NOT get dim enough at night to be a real nightstand clock -- I hope you're listening Amazon).  But still, what to do with that display?  All it really does is cycle through a bunch of pop culture tidbits.  I can and should add calendar entries, but there needs to be more.  How about:- A weather widget with a 48-hour forecast- A better news widget (think Google news -- how about curated Washington Post feed?)- The full Alexa app on-box (did I mention you can't really manage alarms and timers from the Show itself?)For the money invested, I was really hoping for a more useful display.

B01J24C0TI	This lack of backward compatibility with my old Echo was annoying to the point that I decided to return the ...	This unit was not at all compatible with what I already set up on my Echo.  It did not know any of the control commands (like shut off the lights) and wanted me to "reprogram" it separately (I already spent many, many hours getting the Echo to work with my automated home products -and, for some reason, the Show COULD NOT SEAMLESSLY REPLACE THE ECHO FEATURES).  This lack of backward compatibility with my old Echo was annoying to the point that I decided to return the Show rather than spend hours getting it to work.  Unlike the Echo, it is very difficult to know when Alexa wakes when standing behind the unit  because it does not have a light on the back or sides (like Echo's revolving light display).  You can turn on an audible alert of Alexa's waking, but that disappears when power is lost (as does the wake word for my Dot)  and is not loud enough to be effective.  And, speaking of sound, THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE SHOW IS VERY MUCH INFERIOR TO THE ECHO.  The unit does not have 360 degree sound and the volume is most  inferior to the Echo.  I simply had to return this  product because I feel that it was not well thought out. before launching.	valco	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1CK86Y5N7C3L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	1	2017/07/19
B01J24C0TI	A perfect nightstand computer, with just a few enhancements.	This is a fun piece of tech to own! It's definitely very expensive for what it can do, though. You need to ask yourself if you're willing to pay extra for gen-1 gadgets. That being said, my score would go up to 5 if amazon just PLEASE pre-bundle a wake up experience that let me:* Set a daily alarm time* Wake me up gently with a chosen piece of music or radio station* Once sensing or verbally hearing that I'm awake ...* ... switch to my morning flash brief.Most of those things are already features and I really can't imagine that the rest would be all that hard. *Music slowly fades in to wake you up. * "Echo, I'm awake." * music stops, flash brief begins. *Come on, Amazon - make it happen! :)Extra bonus points if you could please _vastly_ expand the YouTube/Amazon movie selection interface. I get that you want to keep voice commands as the first-class interaction tool, but I want to watch my favorite youtubers' channels while I go to sleep and that's not possible with this interface. At BEST I can play one _specific_ video if I remember its exact name.All in all I suspect they haven't envisioned this as a bedstand computer-clock and that's a shame because that is the PERFECT use case for me.Despite any negativity in that review, I really do like my Echo Show. I hope they make those enhancements! It would be awesome.	Erich Blume	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/ARY1W5KU2QA4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2017/07/19

So far I feel like it's just a running of jeopardy type questions (no,I didn't pay $228 to find out what the mass of the moon is and no, I don't want to play a jazz list).

Most notably, the voice recognition does not work as well as the Echo. I could be a couple feet away from the Show and ask it a question but my Echo all the way across the room will pick up the request and respond. Video playback is also tricky. I had to ask half a dozen questions before the Show would respond with a video. Questions like "How do you cook [X]?" should be able to respond with cooking videos from YouTube or Amazon Video, but instead the Show could not process the question. All in all the Show is just OK. I will keep mine with hope that Amazon will improve the product over time, but for now I would not recommend it to others.

B01J24C0TI	Device of the future after software and some hardware issues are solved.	7/17/2017: The Echo Show seems like sneak preview of the future as a small touchscreen with touch + voice command and decent speaker system will be the swiss army knife data collection point for home automation, security, personal scheduling, sleep tracking, baby monitoring, weather and news, etc.But, this device is not the future yet. Both the native software interface and third-party support are as clunky as the Agro Cragg Industrial Design.  3rd party support including the screen will likely grow but it's currently limited and an on-board "skills store" for finding new skills is sorely needed. The touchscreen doesn't support or even display the same selections as voice navigation so you're left guessing what to tell Alexa in order to navigate and it's pretty frustrating at times when you can't find the right YouTube video, etc.The speaker playback is good for a device this size, a hair muddled in voice reproduction. Also background noise (hiss) is audible at lower levels (25% or below) during content playback. That is not a problem on the original Echo. It would be nice to see a live on-screen translation of speech-to-text to determine whether it didn't understand what I said because it translated speech-to-text incorrectly or whether it translated it correctly and couldn't interpret a command from what was said.However, if used on a nightstand next to a bed (which I would expect is probably either the first or second most common usage of this device), there are additional troubles which make this unusable. First is that the backlight on the screen is too bright even if showing a clock on black background (do-not-disturb mode). Second is the power supply emits a tone which (7kHz, 45 dB at 1 meter as installed) which makes it almost impossible to sleep in a quiet environment.I expect I'll like this better with continued software updates; however, the screen and power supply issues mentioned above mean that I will likely be returning one for now.

B01J24C0TI	Love ALL my Echo devices!	I recently ordered two Echo Shows (one black and one white) via Best Buy after my daughter and her family came for a short visit. They received their preordered Echo Show just before they left to come for their visit so they brought it with them. I liked it...so after they left I ordered two Echo Show's and got the $100 discount. The only reason I ordered via Best Buy was because I was able to get 12 months free financing on my purchase. My Echo family has grown...currently I have two Echo's, two Echo Dot's, one Echo Tap and now two Echo Show's...LOVE them all! Yesterday I requested an invitation to be able to purchase the Echo Look. I ordered a little 8" turntable via Amazon so I can swivel my nightstand Echo Show and liked it so much I'm having a second one delivered today for my other Echo Show!EDIT: I forgot to mention how I use my Echo’s... Local Weather, weather from areas where my family members live. Music, Videos, Audio Books etc... Amazon Music Unlimited, My Amazon Music, Pandora Radio, Tunein, iHeart Radio. My Calendar Events, Voice/Test msgs, Amazon Notifications, News Briefings, LiveWatch security system via Alarm . com, Philips Hue Lights, RING doorbell, Honeywell Total Connect for changing my thermostat settings, reading audio books via Audible, recently added “Drop In” with family members using Echo Show...and the list goes on!

B01J24C0TI	I do like the quick and responsive answers	I've had the Show for only 2 days.  It sits on a dresser in a bedroom. It replaces a Sony Dash that is no longer supported.  We used the Dash for tine and temp.  I'm an older person and wish I could adjust the font on the show to be a bit larger as it is a distance away.  I do like the quick and responsive answers. I would like to be able to ask Alexia to show the current local weather radar map.I'm sure in generation 2 of the Echo show, it may have some of the features people have written in the reviews.  In the mean time, well, OK for now.	mark e in kc	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/APJEC8BJMH93K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/07/16
B01J24C0TI	The future of home and voice integration	The resolution is lacking but this is the  way to go with voice and home automation.The sound is an improvement over the larger Echo. Be warned the camera is always on and if you enable video people can connect without prompting. I'm sure this 'feature' will be improved.4 stars because of the resolution, the camera always being on, and the poor security if you enable messaging.This sets the standard moving forward. Love it.

B01J24C0TI	Amazon Show .. Useful, but first generation limitations	Used the show for about 4 hours. Generally I like the function, but four things require improvement:1. Crisper screen resolution. Sharper Display2. Faster CPU - Better performance3. Improved Audio. It is good, but The this price point, needs to be better4. Improved Audio/Video combined dialog with user.

B01J24C0TI	Just not for me.	I was hesitant from the onset about purchasing the Echo because I did not see how it really differed from my iPhone or iPad. ok, so it does differ when it comes to control commands in the home and the ability to fulfill other requests. For what the Echo Show does, I should have just purchased the little Echo Dot.I found the verbal response time to be delayed and sometimes inaccurate.  Based upon how my kitchen is set up, I can see my large screen tv from every angle.  The screen on the Echo Show has to be viewed straight on and to perfectly frank, I found ti to be totally useless.  This is not meant to offend Amazon but I can watch the same the things on my iPad.  I  can ask Siri about the weather etc...If you have a small kitchen and spend a fair amount time in that space, maybe the Echo Show is for you.  It just wasn't for me.  After 5 days, I returned it.

B01J24C0TI	The sound quality and the dictation suck dog balls.	Poor sound quality and for some reason, it can't understand anything we say to it.

B01J24C0TI	A logical upgrade of the Echo family of devices with many new skills	I spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I can drop into my children's homes if they have a Show in their's. It has good sound and video, shows me lyrics of songs and shows information in type big enough to read from a few feet away. Like the original Echo, it keeps adding new abilities and let's you know on screen when something new is available. For example, with the All Recipes skill enabled you can see the recipe on the screen and the Show will describe the recipe and tell you how long it will take to make it.	D.

B01J24C0TI	Doesn't seem to hear very well!  As deaf as Grandma.	I have multiple other Alexa devices, including a new Element TV.  It's not like this is new to me.The listening skills of Echo Show are junk. its in my kitchen, and most of the time when I say"Alexa", the Dot in the living room will answer. I literally have to get within 2 feet of it, and speak loudly.  The only positive thing about this device is its ability to stream lyrics while playing music. I can now see what some of the mumbled lyrics of 70s songs are.Really, really disappointed. Wish I'd never wasted my money!

B01J24C0TI	WAIT FOR 2ND GENERATION - LOTS OF BUGS, SLOW, POOR SPEECH RECOGNITION AND ACCURACY COMPARED TO OTHER ECHOS	Bought two and sent them both back.  I have used the Echo and Echo Dot.  Compared to those, this unit is MUCH SLOWER and does not pick up voice recognition as well.  The video feature needs a lot of perfecting.  Not many of the "SKILLS" are applicable.  Came across several bugs, like accuracy, speed, freezing screens, and horrible video touch screen interface.  Save your money and wait for the second generation to come out.  This one stinks.

B01J24C0TI	Sound is not as good as the original Echo.	My family and I own two original Echo's, three Echo dots and a Kindle Fire 10".  They are all used heavily.  I debated for a while if the advatages of this device outweigh just using the Kindle Fire's built in Alexa feature.  In the end I decided that it's superior sound and always on state would be worth the price compared to the Kindle Fire.  While the screen is very nice and responsive, the sound is below par with what I expected.  The original Echo has a much better sound.  This unit seems to have a much more limited accoustic range especially on the low end.	csciguy	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A23OKZ6JSAWSZT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	3	2017/07/16

B01J24C0TI	GREAT PRODUCT, SURPRISINGLY USEFUL!	What, an Amazon Alexa that has a screen? I of course thought gimmick! However, over a period of two weeks I have found the Show to be incredibly useful.The unit guides you though setup and makes it easy to personalize for your needs. For those of you not familiar with how Alexa works, you must load the app on your phone, (free download,) and select SKILLS. Skills are functions that alexa can perform. You load these skills and set them up the way it best suits your own uses.For instance, I set up a skill that allows me to find where in my home I put my iPhone. I say:"Alexa, find my phone." Alexa responds with "Do you want me to call your phone?" I respond and my phone rings, hiding from me under a pillow on the couch!There is an important fact that you should be aware of. If you set up your Show and expect it to work perfectly immediately, that is not the case. You do have to wait a few minutes for the server to capture and set up your data. I waiting about 10 minutes and everything was fine. Unfortunately I learned this the hard way! Right after setup I immediately gave commands like "Alexa, turn on my hallway air cleaner" or "Alexa turn on master bedroom light."Drove me crazy as it would just not work, Finally I talked to a support person at Amazon and he was the one to inform me that you had to give their servers time to process your data. After about 30 minutes, it worked perfectly.Luckily Amazon was smart enough to set up a customer service area just for Alexa help and questions. Just call customer service and ask them to connect you to Alexa Support. Once there, you can ask the support rep to send an email listing all the ways you can contact them.As for the screen, it's nice and bright, clear and quite legible in a dark or bright room. You can ask Alexa for a Flash Bruefing and will get be you a short newscast right on the screen from a source you previously selected; mine was CNN.The sound is decent and is not distorted even at slightly high levels. The audio from their speakers is definitely decent unless you are a real audiophile.Alexa Show is not inexpensive, but if you use it all the time like I do, it is worth the investment!

B01J24C0TI	Works as advertised, but sound is too directional and boxy.	The Show is working well for video conferencing, but the sound is fairly 'boxy', mid-bass heavy, and is highly directional.  The directionality caught me off guard, but it makes sense, it appears to use front firing speakers.  The Dot has better sound from an 'any location' perspective.	mam	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A163KHTRGHLBU7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/07/16

B01J24C0TI	Great potential, but for now I prefer dot	. I really wanted to like this one. The commercial was awesome, and I a big Kindle/echo fan . But at the end , the Show is clumsy , so-so sound quality, small screen, and voice recognition not as good as $50 dot. Or maybe I am just asking more from it. It has troubles finding what I want on YouTube, video navigation sucks, phone video conf is better on Skype , basically, I see no advantages over Dot with a good Bluetooth speaker (I use Harman kardon onyx) . Maybe the next version will be better,but for me this.one is a dissapointment. I  am returning both Shows and sticking with Dots and Kindles HDX.

B01J24C0TI	Glitch	Consider this an interim review. I download my work schedule into my Apple calendar from a corporate web sight. It appears correctly on the calendars of all my devices. My iCloud time zone is correct. When I ask Alexa about my work schedule it always subtracts 4 hours. So even though my start time is 12:45 PM Alexa will say 8:45.

B01J24C0TI	Amazon Show, a great multimedia device that is still improving.	Giving it just four stars for now, there seems to be a problem with X-ray lyrics on the Show. Unlike on my phone or tablet I cannot get lyrics to display for song in my Amazon music library. Amazon is currently working on the problem and will let me know once they find the solution. Besides that the show is a great device and if the lyrics issue is fixed I will probably buy one or two more for different rooms in the house. The Show has great video replay and the speakers are excellent. Love being able to watch Amazon movies on my nightstand while I'm writing or getting ready for bed. One other feature the Show could use is a remote control, sometime while in the closet the Show can't hear my requests and a remote would help and not make me scream.

I also like that you can change the Echo name. They give you three other options that you can pick from in the settings. The sound quality is great but not as good as the original Echo.

You cannot just ask alexa to find a video on "XYZ".  If she was connected to youtube she'd be able to!I hope amazon finds more intuitive ways to use the screen when interacting with Alexa.  At the moment, for the price, buy the echo or like 4 echo dots	Ryeguy	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2Z0V2Q0ANL31U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	3	2017/07/15

B01J24C0TI	Do not buy if you have Philips Hue Kit or if you want to hook up philips smart lights	I have been a long time Amazon customer, I was among the first people to get the Amazon echo when it first came out. Amazon echo was wonderful, I loved it and with time I connected Philips Hue and other smart devices with it. I pre-ordered Amazon Show hoping it would be a product as good as the Echo.Unfortunately, Amazon Show is an incomplete product with a super buggy software. It does not recognize my Philips lights (even my amazon dot does). I spent the past 5 hours going back and forth with the customer care trying to fix the issue but I couldnt. Even the customer care was disappointing, they accepted that it was a software glitch and the best they could offer me was a return with free shipping ( I mean really?). I bought 2 show's to save the $100 but now I have to send it back and order it again when they fix the issue and pay $100 more for the device.Please do not buy this if you have philips lights with version 1 and version 2 of the Bridge. It will not work and you will end up wasting time just like I did. The customer service was rude too.

The advertisement said you could see the lyrics to your songs from your Amazon music app but that is not true. You must have amazon music unlimited in order to use this feature. Also I think the sound quality on the show is not as good as the echo itself. But with that said I do really like the show.

B01J24C0TI	Excellent but could have been better.	I have two of these Echo shows the microphone quality is great and picture is good way better than the nucleus intercom. It's awesome being able to see what Alexa is talking about instead of just hearing it. Now for the problems there's no physical shutter to block the camera only a button to turn it on and off and the button also turns off the microphone so it's both on or both off not one or the other. There is not separate volumes for when Alexis speaks to you and the music playback so expect to be adjusting the volume often so you can hear what Alexa is saying if you're like me you listen to music at a low volume especially at night time when sleeping when I wake up in the morning I like to ask her the briefing or the weather but the volume down low from the music so I have to stop her turn the volume up and then start over then when I go to play music the music is blasting loud. This should be a simple fix considering there are separate volumes for the alarm. Another problem no IR lights which means no night vision so if you doing a video or just checking in on a room you have to turn the lights on. Also while in a video call Alexa will do only pretty much hang up or end call she won't turn the lights on or off or do anything else that's a problem no IR light can't see in the dark and can't turn the lights on while in a call. No ethernet port no USB port no SD card slot only one hole for the power cord enough said about that. Also does not work with things that claims it does says it works with ring video doorbell it does barely you cannot answer the doorbell only ask Alexa to see the front door no two-way conversation nucleus intercom does this quite well I was very disappointed that this does not. Nucleus cameras sure you can pull them up but you see them for a second then buffering then you see it for another second then buffering and not even the good type of buffering where you can see an image and it's frozen the screen just goes black and says buffering so trying to make out anything on them is pretty hard unless you have a photographic memory. But still a very good purchase just make sure when you get one to tell Amazon every problem you see in every problem you have so they fix it cuz if no one speaks up nothing gets fixed. Separate volumes FIX IT!!!!	Hacksaw	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A3W0WKT149WUUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	3	2017/07/14

B01J24C0TI	Need a rep to contact me about the Echo Show, so far it is not doing very well.	I am looking for a way to get the attention of someone at the company since there are no instructions to contact a rep about this product. The device will not pair with my account so many of the features that I use the regular Echo device for will not even work on this device because it won't properly pair the account to my app. There is no way to reset or re-pair the device from what I can see, and there is no help me section for the device either. Right now I have a small box tv that randomly shows whatever it wants to show and not what I would like it to do. Can someone please contact me for assistance. I didn't want to put it out here on this forum but I don't have much of a choice since Amazon seems to hide any way to talk to a person about an issue with a product they have.

B01J24C0TI	Dim Screen	I pre-ordered my Echo Show for automatic shipment to me when available. Setup was very easy, but when I played music I heard horribly distorted sound which I believed could not be normal. I decided to request a replacement. Amazon immediately shipped another unit to me which I received 2 days later and requested return of the defective unit within 30 days for full credit and no shipping charges. After setup, the Alexa app on my iPhone showed the replacement listed as Echo Show 2. The Echo Show was listed as Offline and the Wake Word was grayed out. I was able to change the Echo Show 2 Wake Word to "Echo". Bottom line: Amazon's service excellent, product is almost excellent (see next paragraph), and I'm very impressed by its features.The reason I've rated it with four stars is that the screen is much dimmer than my iPhone and iPad. Ideally there would be voice commands to increase/decrease brightness or at least a fixed level brighter screen. I can't believe that this was not criticized during early panel testingUPDATE: I updated this review to 5 stars after using the Echo Show for a week. The brightness is adjustable! Tell the Echo to play "Getting Started". I still have a few gripes.Anyone who experienced poor sound should replace the unit ... I noted this comment in half a dozen reviews. In my case, my speaker was defective. The replacement sounds great. I strongly recommend a replacement, it's worth the trouble. My minor gripes: the first applies to all Echos. This is an engineering change: add on/off volume normalization! Music tracks vary in volume and news briefings vary WIDELY in volume. Hopefully YouTube and major cable providers access be available in the future. The only other improvement would be more "How To" documentation. Is there a user forum? If so, talk about it in the getting started video.	Nathaniel Lewis	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A198720BMZKB2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/14
B01J24C0TI	Video Freezing When Using Drop In Video from Alexa App to Echo Show	Really like the Echo Show.  Love the drop in feature.  Great to be able to drop in to assist elderly relatives and check in with them.  Would like to see the Alexa App updated to be able to control Amazon Movies on the Echo Show.  Also having big problem with video freezing when connecting to the show from the Alexa app on Android phone.  OK for short time and then it freezes after awhile.  Since this makes the drop in feature almost worthless and this was the main reason I purchased the Echo Show it's definitely not creating a good user experience for me.	Lynn H.

Overall, I'm enjoying this product.  I'm sure it will get even better with further development.One thing I noticed today.  Went into Device Options and saw Check for Software Updates, tapped the link and sure enough there was a software update.  Perhaps it would have updated itself later but there should be some kind of notice at least when updates are available.  A few hours later I asked Echo 'where's my stuff?' and it told me and then offered to provide an alert when a package was delivered in the future.	L.J.

B01J24C0TI	Love my Alexa(s)	The Echo products just keep getting better and better, and Echo Show is the best so far.  Our family keeps the Show in our open concept kitchen which allows us easy listening and communication from the living room and dining room, too.  I'm an Allrecipes subscriber and really enjoy using the recipes on Echo Show that can be activated by voice or touchscreen.  Since we also have a dot and original Echo in different rooms, the drop in feature works great as an intercom.  The one thing I wish would improve on the Echo devices is the ability to answer general knowledge questions easily.  My Alexa allows my handicapped son to easily make phone calls connected to my Ooma device.

B01J24C0TI	For A First Try, Quite Admirable.	It does exactly as promises.  Instead of saying "Alexa" and seeing a circle of flashing lights - the video screen comes to life.  The speakers are heavy on bass and quite good.  You can, if so incline, pair them to a bluetooth speaker quite easily but these speakers are good enough for any music fan.Basically, it does everything the Echo Dot does and more.  Although only 7 inches, you can watch videos.  So, it is the next generation Dot but still there are a few disappointments and room for improvements.I was able to link my AMAZON PHOTOS for the home screen to make it a little more user friendly.  However, no matter how I try, AMAZON "hints" keep scrolling across the screen.  It would be fine with me just to see the time and temperature or even the time and date on the home screen but this is not to be and it makes it seem a little oppressive as even the news trends are repeated for hours and sometimes days.But it is small, compact and if you are getting to the point where you can't live without Alexa for your calendar/ appointments/ shopping and To Do lists/ finding out quick facts from Wikipedia then this is a step up for you.

However, It is TERRIBLE at playing Amazon video purchases (would not support one of my movie purchases and only plays the last episode of any TV Show purchases from Amazon. What is worse is the fact that none of the Amazon techs that I spent more than 7 hours talking to in a fruitless attempt to figure out why my purchased videos would not play on the Show, knew much/nothing about this device. Thank goodness Amazon is letting me return these things - but it is still a disappointment	MRI Queen	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/APA9F0O686DQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	2	2017/07/14

B01J24C0TI	Does a nice job!	I own four Amazon ECHO's, SPOTS, etc.One of the nice features is that when SHOW plays music from Amazon MUSIC - it can show the lyrics on the screen.  A very nice addition.Also handy for displaying recipes.I have also asked it to show me the first STAR TREK episode and it handled this well.There are a few glaring omissions IMHO.  One being that SHOW can not display the weather RADAR - seems like this should be a basic skill.  Maybe this skill can be added over time.	E.

B01J24C0TI	Would buy again and again!	I am in love with my new Echo Show and I bought 2.  So now I have 2 show's, 3 Echo's and 3 dot's.  I do not have any smart home features yet as my entire home is recessed can lighting.  So at this time, I cannot figure out features to automate.  If anyone has any thoughts, please let me know.Anyhow, I love my show!!  I love how it is constantly scrolling telling me new things to try.  My husband has even taken to using it all the time.  He can ask for the news and it will play the news and he can actually watch it on the screen.  I do not have a problem with viewing the screen from angles.  I don't feel like I have to be right in front of it.  I also have to wear glasses for everything and I feel like I can see it from across the room well.  And believe me that is a challenge for me.  I cannot read the clock, but I can read the show.  AND, If I cannot read it, I can always ask.  We are always playing around trying to learn new things, so not only is it useful, it is so much fun.The price is good, but really hoping for a sale, as I would swap out my dot's for a show in a second.  The dots are fun, but the speakers don't work well on their own.  They work best with a Bluetooth speaker.Before all of my Echo's, I used to listen to music on my entire home audio system, however, with the show and amazon music, I have so many more options that it has made my home audio obsolete.  Cannot recommend enough!	Amazon Customer	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1KVB76K40W7V5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2017/07/13

The main reason I got this was to be able to connect with my elderly mom in the evenings. She lives 2 hours away and she says it's like spending the evenings with us. She is 92 years young. (I bought 2 Echo Shows, 1 for her and 1 for me) It was fairly simple to set up. The only thing that I have problems with is hanging up the call with the phone app. I can't seen to find where to do that. I also read where you can interface the Echo Show with the Ring video door bell. That will be my next project.

B01J24C0TI	Not ready yet	Having owned all the echo products to this point, I just couldn't find any way the show added to the equation. Tried it in kitchen but angle to view it was awkward. In bedroom it was no better as an alarm clock than the dot. It also had a much larger footprint than it appears in the photos. A few years back there was the chumby and Sony dash, they had more available to them then this does now. I'm sure amazon will get it right either the second or third generation, but not yet	K.

B01J24C0TI	it would be perfect. What I loved about the dash was that ...	I won't repeat all the other reviews. I own three Sony Dashes. Sony stopped supporting them years ago but some of the functions still worked albeit very limited. Coincidentally, Sony decided to completely pull the plug this month and now they are a large brick with a clock  and only alarm functionality. Knowing this was going to soon  happen hastened my decision to buy the show. Frustratingly, if the two devices could merge, it would be perfect. What I loved  about the dash was that at a quick glance I had Google news scrolling, could see my other apps, see the time /days /weather and If  I had any alarms set. What I love about the show is, obviously, the voice control and video calling ability. If amazon updates the show to have more personalization where I could tile everything I want to see at one glance, I'd love it.Now, I am not going to ding amazon, exactly, for what I feel it lacks since I knew what it could/couldn't (yet)  do before I bought it. I can't stand reading reviews with people complaining their item can't do this or that when they knew when they bought it instead of reviewing it based on what it said it could do and how well it achieves that. My hope, more or less, is that if enough people chime  in that perhaps amazon will offer more personalization. The show is certainly capable of having tile  view, etc, but amazon will need to see that it is a common want before they bother with an update of that magnitude. I considered replacing the dash with a tablet but, again, there is no way to have everything showing that you want. I used to call also watching the Google News stream across.One thing I hope will get refined is the time it takes when you drop in to when you can actually view the person you dropped in on, mine takes a good 15-20 seconds ...Unless that is caused by my internet (now spectrum which has slowed considerably since they bought time Warner).

B01J24C0TI	Not as good as the original Amazon Echo - delayed verbal processing.	So, having returned one Echo Show because of delayed verbal performance, ask Echo a questions, the answer is pushed to the screen within 3-4 seconds but the verbal answer can be delayed by up to 20 seconds, the second unit still seems to have similar issues.Compare the verbal performance to the original Echo, its woeful.  I could understand that the visual returned info might be delayed, as it's a new factor to the Echo service.The verbal performance should be just as fast as the original unit and it isn't.  It has the same network access through our firewall as the first Echo unit and we're not seeing any traffic being blocked outbound.So Amazon either has some flawed units out there or they have changed the process/information flow from the original Echo unit.If the visual aspect to the show isn't that important to you, I'd recommend staying with the original Audio based Echo, the extra $$ needed for the Show doesn't appear to be a worthwhile spend right now.

B01J24C0TI	Exciting!	This 'thing' (sometimes hard to remember it is an object) - is awesome!  In our home it has created the most interest and curiosity for a machine since the Atari 400 of the 70’s/80’s entered.  All the cellphones, PC’s, etc. in between were great steps but only seemed ‘nice’ and not real exciting.  This is a game changer.  Keyboards are in danger of becoming obsolete.Like anything new we are still getting a handle on it.  Several Alexa questions end in the machine not understanding or knowing where to look for an answer.  Understand it needs time to assemble data and am looking for new behaviors going forward.

B01J24C0TI	OK for 1.  Awful with 2 or more devices.	We took the bait and bought 2 Shows.  (I was confident that Amazon would produce a quality product).  Wrong.Here is my experience:1)  I spent over 2 hours with tech support trying to get my devices to accept calls from each other.  Setting aside the fact that English is not the first language of tech support plus the fact that they apparently have limited if any experience with the product, it was at times incredibly difficult and frustrating to understand what was being said.  I lost track of the number of times I had to say "I don't understand what you said".2)  Each contact person I spoke with REQUIRES:  spelling my email address, slowly pronouncing my name, stating my account name,  repeating my house number, street address, city and state. I ended up doing this 4 times as I was 'shuttled' to someone who was a more advanced 'tech support' person.  Plus I had to repeat the entire reason I called to each person.  Hello?  Here is an idea:  "Share the caller's information with other employees as the call is passed up the support line."  Can't you use AWS to solve this problem?3)  It turned out that the inability to call another Show device was the result of needing to link to a second account which would be connected to the 2nd Show device.  OK.  That worked.  (It took 1.5 hours to figure that one out)4)  This begs the question "Do I need a separate account for each Show I purchase?  What if I want a 3rd in my kitchen?5)  So, I call tech support ... again.  They inform me that I do not need another account for a 3rd Show but I do need to 'turn on' Drop-In.  If I do not have Drop-In turned on it will not work?  Huh?  Why is that?  They can not say.6)  The summary of this situation is that as 'kewl' as the produce idea is, Amazon Show is not ready for real customer use.  (It probably works well if you want to purchase just 1; but given their enticing offer of $100 off if you buy 2, I must say "If that is your need, look elsewhere.")  They should have a)  trained their support staff on the product and it's features and b) beta tested multiple product use.  But, apparently Amazon uses it's customers as beta testers.I am returning my devices.

It is necessary to tilt it forward for smaller children. Also sometimes it doesn't pick up requests from across the room. It was necessary to speak louder.

I have it controlling all of our smart home lights, thermostats and will be expanding to door sensors shortly.  Our house is 100% Apple HomeKIt driven, but I prefer Alexa over Siri, and have integrated the two seamlessly.  It plays music with lyrics, calls me an Uber when I need one to go to the airport, and handles my calendar for me in a visible fashion.  All day long it scrolls pictures, and pulls up top news stories that i may want to read.  All in all, it is by far the best Echo product, and I am still learning new ways to use it.  The most frustrating part is trying to keep track of all the cool things that this is capable of.	Mathew J.

B01J24C0TI	Very useful and has more uses then initially thought!	Great Device.  The screen helps a lot vs. the traditional echo in viewing cameras, viewing shopping list, viewing lyrics, and just generally seeing what command it listens to.  I would recommend this unit for the kitchen use as it will flash by useful news that's easy to read more by asking alexa and it will show you responses for recipes and timers.  Definitely a good device.	Keith Newlander	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AUJWP901VCRQ9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/13

B01J24C0TI	The Best Parts of Echo Get Better!	I love Echo... it's such a part of our family my kids are constantly calling out "Alexa" even when we are away from home. This leads to the embarrassing "Echo moment" when you realize she isn't there. Echo show is best described by others I'm sure but all I can say is: Wow! All the old features I won't rehash but with Echo Show my news flash briefing in the morning is now like a little TV newscast just for me. I would like to see a few more regions added for local news but most states have a larger participating news station that will do for now. People said before this came out that the screen would be too small to enjoy watching Amazon Video or any videos for that matter. Actually the screen is much larger than I thought and the convenience is NOT having additional space wasted by having a large screen in the kitchen. I only hope cooking apps and channels are added so that when Echo is in the kitchen she acts like a visual cooking instructor that you can pause and cook along with. Until then watching "Jacque and Julia Cooking at Home" on our Echo will do just fine!	J.

B01J24C0TI	Cool so far, needs one major feature...	So far this seems like a pretty cool product, i'm still a bit confused with the Amazon calling feature and how to ask it to call what, for example i have a echo show at home in my kitchen and in my office downtown.  I want to call my home so i suppose i just say Alexa, call..."the name of the home device" but im not really sure.Also, id like to see some type of PIN feature or lock feature, for example when i leave my office technically my employees could walk in and say Alexa show me the living room cam and see my living room, when i leave my office it would be nice if i could lock the unit somehow so i wouldn't have to worry about people possible looking at my cams or going through my calendar, photos etc...

B01J24C0TI	Nice display and awesome sound.	We were excited to get the new Echo Show because it works with our Ring video doorbell, but were disappointed that it only SHOWS the front door and you are not able to talk to the visitor through the Echo Show. You still have to use your phone app to do that. Hopefully there will be an update that will allow it. You can "drop in" on someone for a video chat, but of course the other person has to have an Echo Show as well. You can view your lists, calendar, and other things on the screen, and some songs show the lyrics while they play. The speakers really sound good and the display is really nice. (By the way.be sure to purchase the screen protector if you order an Echo Show.)We are pleased with ours and we are still learning new things every day.	elaine_mc	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2SPJJVMDVSTSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/07/13

B01J24C0TI	Great product, but not so great for streaming of music	I own a Amazon Echo (the big one) which is awesome and has great sounds for listening to music.I also own a Echo dot, which I use in the office to listen to music. Sound is not as great as the large Echo but still nice to have in the office.I use these to call each other (Echos can call each other), so one for home one for office.I bought two Echo Shows to replace these two. I am not sure about that anymore.The Echo Show is great and as advertised, but when I am trying to listen to music, there is a disturbing amount of buffering. Exact same Wifi.The Echo Dot on the other hand, has no issues with playing music, no stop or buffering even once.So now I use both side by side in my office. I had to change the command for the new Echo Show as "Echo" instead of "Alexa" so the two don't get confused.Echo Show is used to call the other Echo Show at home to see the kids.Echo Dot is used exclusively for music listening.Would have been great if I could just use the Echo Show instead of having both but after the first couple of hours, the buffering was too disturbing.Same disturbing buffering with movie streaming as well.	sdress user	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A1K2DX7SY23OT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	3	2017/07/13

I don't have prime and own a combo of 6 Alexa's. I don't need prime a co worker has it and I and about 10 other people give her 10 bucks a year... so she has free prime... anyway the show is AWSOME love that it plays movie trailers on point , love the video calling, not to mention the fun of controlling , lights, thermostat's , fans , dyson air purifier, locks, arlo cams, arlarm system  ect.. I'm like Captain Kirk and iron man around the house , so much fun!!!

I love them all, sometimes it's frustrating when she can't answer a question, but seems like they have been improving alot on these since I got my first one maybe couple years ago.  Wish my kids would take one but because there is no privacy with everything being in the "clouds" they wont have them in their home.

The Echo Show is the buggiest Echo product I own (and I own them all.)Example:  the screen will not clear my message about package delivery.  This cuts my screen size by 1/3.  I've tried to clear it, yet it persists.  The Alexa App won't let me turn off Amazon package notifications.  Even when I turn the screen off, the message remains.  When I play a movie, it remains.  Anyway, you get the picture.  You might want to wait until the bugs are worked out.

B01J24C0TI	The camera integration with various Smart Home providers also works decently	The Echo Show is definitely an interesting product. If you haven't interacted with one in person, it's basically an Android driven touchscreen built into an Echo device. Unlike a typical Android tablet, however, there are no icons and very little interaction is done with the touchscreen.By default, the screen simply shows the time and current weather in the top left, with a rotating view of Alexa tips, calendar events and news items on the bottom portion of the screen and a randomly chosen background picture.When you talk to Alexa, a blue gradient bar appears on the bottom edge of the screen (reminiscent of the blue light on the original Echo) and the text of her response shows up on the screen. If there are multiple choices, they are listed on the screen and you can reference them by number as well as touch them.The camera integration with various Smart Home providers also works decently, albeit a bit slow to connect sometimes. But overall, the touchscreen on the Echo Show puts an interesting spin on the concept of the Echo devices.

The device did take time to load as it was downloading an update. Alexa started introducing the device and features. Here are skills that we use daily, timers: such ease, no need to poke around on your phone. YouTube trailers:Alexa shows a notification as soon as a new trailer comes out and immediately plays it if prompted. Music requires a little effort and needs clear enunciation when band or song names are similar to another.

B01J24C0TI	Really like it so far	First off people need to understand this is not a voice activated tablet. This is the echo with a screen. I so far like it a lot. I have had the echo since it first came out and have added a few dots to my collection as well. The show is my favorite of the bunch.Sound- The sound quality is better than the original echo. When turned up it's very loud and I can hear music from it well into the next room and even upstairs. Is it as good as some of the top Bluetooth speakers out there no but its a step up from the echo and I am happy with it. The sound when using it for calls is good very clear.The Screen- When I first got my echo my first thought was why does this not have a screen? So when I saw the Show I was very excited. I love being able to look at it to see what song is playing or sing along to a song I don't know the words tpp(though its prime music only not your own library which kind of stinks).Video Calling- This feature was one that I was also excited about. I bought one for myself and one for my parents. We have been using Skype for years but it seems to be getting buggier and more annoying. The show does it well. Good video and sound easy to use perfect for what we use it for. It does stink a little that the camera can not be rotated at all the camera is at a high angle and a little annoying but it's not a huge deal to me.Everything Else- I am disappointed in what skills work with the show at the moment I am sure more will be coming but it would have been nice to have a few ready to go. One obvious one would be a weather radar how nice would it be to say Alexa show me the weather radar. There is a lot of opportunities here and it would be nice to see some fast acting on that front.Slightly Annoying- Ugh Amazon stop giving me suggestions to try on EVERY screen. I get maybe having it for a day or two but there needs to be a setting to turn that off pronto!  Thankfully you can turn off the trending news and your calendar and also only have it scroll through them once but I would rather my calendar items be seen all the time not try this or try that. Also more controls over notifications. Yes, you can turn notification off on the device but it would be nice to have skill notifications for each device as well. Also, it would be nice if I do want the news and calendar items to continuously rotate to have some setting for how long it pauses between pages.Really Annoying- This is more the whole echo line. Come on Amazon it's time to allow all devices to play music at the same time or pick two or more. I don't understand why you have not done this but its time I really hope its on the short to do list!Overall I think this is a good device and has the potential to be a great device. I know it will get better and better with time just like the echo did.	weatherlover1	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AAGI1CIBNP0P0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	4	2017/07/12
B01J24C0TI	I love my new Echo Show	I love my new Echo Show.  It's a great addition to the many dots and handful of full sized echos that I use to control my smart home.  The speaker quality is much improved over the others, and the addition of the screen is a huge benefit.  At a minimum for real-time monitoring of Arlo, NEST, or Ring cameras but it's also great to get additional data quicker when using voice commands.  I will be buying several for family members so that I can start leveraging the video conferencing more frequently.

B01J24C0TI	Sound volume creates serious sound distortion	The device is amazing with one exception.  When you maximize sound for movie playback or telephone the sound distortion is horrible. The speaker and sound control should be synchronized so prevent this from happening.  Level 8 is max sound level.  I feel this is a design flaw or my device is flawed.

It needs to make the home screen more customizable!  I would love to make the font size of the clock larger to be easier to read without glasses, the ability to adjust brightness and although the notifications can be reduced, the cycling notifications do change the light and is annoying to see brightness changes while trying to sleep.

Alexa suggests commands on the display screen and this is a great way to learn how to talk to Alexa so that she understands what you want.  As developers/Google improve Alexa the Show is going to get even better.  Show music sounds much better than Dot sounds and can get much louder.

B01J24C0TI	Great Alexa addition to keep in touch with family	We were looking around for a birthday gift for my father and figured he would and Echo because he loves listening to his Blues music while in the kitchen and the lists, timers, and other functions would be a nice addition he would enjoy. I saw that the Echo Show would be released in 4 days and thought that it would be an excellent way for us and his grandkids to keep in touch since we live on opposite sides of the country....so we bought two, one for him and one for us.We received our Show on the day they were released and setup was a breeze. My father was even able to get his setup without any help from me, which is a huge plus! His only hang-up occurred when he had to verify his phone number, but after a day or so he called me up on the Show and we were able to video chat without any issue. We're currently working on upgrading his internet connection to accommodate video chatting, but so far we're very happy with our purchase. If this works out we plan to purchase one for each of the grandparents.We keep the Show in our kitchen and use it exactly how we used our Echo, for timers, weathers, news, shopping lists, and most of all music. We have put our Echo in the bedroom and use it as an intercom as well. Just recently for Prime Day we bought a Dot to put in our daughter's room, so we'll see how she likes that.Very happy with the product so far.

B01J24C0TI	Echo Show steals the Show!	I am really impressed with the Echo Show. The only problem I had during set-up was connecting it to my Philips Hue lights.  I could not get it to control individual lights upon initial set-up. I then decided to call customer support for Alexa and they were very helpful.  We were able to resolve the issue by going into the Alexa app and assigning my individual Hue lights to groups.  Once the groups were established with group names, I was then able to control them with Alexa.The speakers on the Alexa Show sound great, but I prefer the ability to connect Show to my Bluetooth speaker and play the music I choose with the Show through this speaker.  I then get the album artwork and lyrics on the Show.If you decide to purchase the Show, you will not be disappointed. It is nice asking Alexa for help with various things or questions and getting a visual with it as well.

B01J24C0TI	The Echo Show Is The Best Ever and I Do Enjoy Having Them Around	OKAY Folks, "Get Ready, Get-Set and Go Get One or Two... Or More!" "I will Be Getting this As Gifts For ALL My Family!!"Basically everything went well, a little bit of trouble with learning proper voice commands and Alexa responding to me at first, "It Takes Time" for her to get to know us as well as we learning all there is to know about Alexa, LOL..."Have Patience will pay off. I did purchase 2 units, one for me and one for my "Love Nuggets" and received a great $100.00 cash discount at point of purchase. I also enrolled in the Family Amazon Unlimited Music Plan and paid $149.00 for one year in advance ($12.42 a month vice $14.99 per month Prime) for this plan and received another great savings. I will be working my way through the many uses, lighting controls, Nest Heating and Cooling Thermostat controls, Cameras, door locks, etc.- etc. to take full advantage of the Echo system as it expands with function, gadgets and services. The screen is a bit small but very sharp and easy to see from a distance, speakers are very good but hope one day to be able to control the Base & Treble to personal taste! I do bet Amazon will be developing a larger screen and a more expanded system later on as the demand increases across the board. In working out the bugs and swinging through MY Learning curves, the awesome Amazon Echo Customer Care/Support Dept with a direct line (877-375-9365) to reach a real person has been worth this Venture! I highly recommend this product, not only as a leading edge Gadget that is fun, but also it is informative and has a real life functionality! that is helpful, even for my age at 74... but at a slower pace, I do get it Kids!!I believe honestly that this investment has been worthwhile and fun at the same time!!  I will up-date this review when I expand the Echo presence in our home and with all our family, stand by folks...Thank you Amazon and the Echo Support Dept.for your 5 Star SupportV/RKent M.

B01J24C0TI	Not great yet	the show is nice. don't like the fact you can never turn it off so cant really use in the bedroom.  hard to remember to turn screen off would be better if it would go into a sleep mode.  also the mics on this aren't as good as the dot or echo  we have all in our home put this in the kitchen and took the dot out  and it just doesn't have the mic range.  they still need to work on this product !!

B01J24C0TI	Less functional than the DOT	For some reason the Show doesn't pick up my voice/dictation as well as the Dot. It's always getting words wrong that the Dot picks up fine. If they are using the same servers and dictation software, I'm not sure why there would be a difference, but there is. Most of the time I will ask the Show to play music and the light will come on indicating that it's listening, but the Show does not respond and the light times out and nothing happens. The speakers sound good for the size, but overall I'm disapointed mostly because it has proven to be much less useful than the Dot  which I have located in the same room. I'm using different wake commands, so I know that one is not interfering with the response of the other. The screen is cool, but there isn't much UI/UX to do anything with. Since the dictation is always wrong I would like to be able to type seachers for music or youtube. Thinking about returning it, but I've always been a fan of Amazon so hopfully an update will fix the bugs and all will be right again.

B01J24C0TI	Amazon's in the lead	The Echo show is so much fun! I wasn't sure about a screen being necessary, as using your voice was the whole idea behind the echo, and I believe that is what has made it so popular. However, after having the 'show' for a couple of weeks now, it's totally sold me. It resides in my kitchen (which seems to be the most logical place) and has become so helpful. From setting timers ( you can watch them count down on the screen) to looking up recipes (Alexa will read them to you while displaying on the screen), to playing music (title and artist are displayed). The screen is clear and has good color. I've been updating my house with smart devices, and the 'show' controls them along with my other echoes and dots. Lights, thermostat, cameras. I really like that I can just ask Alexa to show me one of the camera views, and there it is on the screen. No running to get my phone or iPad to use the device app. The drop in feature is helpful and fun too. I bought my parents a 'show', and they love that feature! lol. It allows you to activate one of your contact's 'show' screen (drop in) and video chat. (it will warn the person you are contacting, that you are 'dropping in'). The only down part for me is that I wish Amazon would have used more premium speakers. Not a deal breaker. I just use my Bose Bluetooth speaker. I'm still discovering more about it, but it has already been so useful. This is definitely the wave of the future, and Amazon is light years ahead.

B01J24C0TI	Echo Show-So far, So Good	So far it seems to function as the pre-release literature and publicity promised.  I have  not  had a great deal of time to fully  explore  the devices potential and possibilities, but I like what I have seen so far. Set up was very easy!  I like  the screen that provides visuals, and I Like the ability to set the device so ALexa can suggest things for you to try as you become more familiar  with it.

B01J24C0TI	Good concept, but sadly, I had to send it back.  This is why...	It makes a great toy for a few days but as novelty wears off it becomes more of a toy than can actually be used for utility (what we were hoping to use it for when we bought it).Pros:1.  The voice assistant is about 2 years ahead of Siri, which is why we gave it 3-stars "it's okay" and not 2-stars "I don't like it".2.  We can naturally speak and it understands us over 50% of the time.3.  Pretty solid speakers and display.Cons ("major" irritations that outweigh the cool-factor benefits):1.  I shouldn't have to buy a separate $150+ device ("Amazon Echo Look") in order to take a picture or short video of myself.  This device has all the hardware it needs to do just that.  I understand Amazon doesn't want to cannibalize its own devices, but seriously?  Common, man.2.  There seems to be no volume equalizer.  When I'm listening to my flash briefing, I have to constantly interrupt the device to turn volume anywhere between 4 and 7.  Almost every briefing is like this.  This should be a simple fix in a future update, but for now it's irritating to change the volume for each briefing.3.  When I add apps (or "skills"), it will automatically add what it deems "news" into my flash briefing.  I want to be able to independently activate just one of them without having to listen to the whole briefing and constantly interrupting it to say "Alexa - Next!" (wait 2 seconds), "Alexa - Next!" (wait 2 seconds), "Alexa - Next!" (wait 2 seconds), "Alexa - Next!" (wait 2 seconds), "Alexa - Next!" (wait 2 seconds).  Oh, finally the briefing I want.  Yes, I am aware I can change the order of the briefing, but this should also be an easy fix.Minor irritations:1.  No customizable home screen.  Well, extremely limited.  Give me widgets.2.  Although it can hook up to bluetooth, it doesn't support Apple Music.3.  No 24-hour clock option.  My wife and I run on 24-hour clock (like the rest of the world).  When I ask to set an alarm for 3 o'clock, I expect it to understand it means afternoon and not ask me "Is that 3 o'clock in the morning, or afternoon?"

B01J24C0TI	Wish I could afford a dozen of them	I can't wait to start using it even more when I have some personal friends who have the Shows as well.  I have a business associate I've used to verify how everything works and now I've decided to act.  I live in Florida and my best friend is in Tennessee.

Build quality is excellent and screen has decent resolution.Great to see cards on screen, adds to value of information. Recipes are easier to follow and fun knowing what the lyrics are in songs. Shopping lists are great on screen and Alexa can add or delete items! GREAT kitchen appliance.Enjoying the camera most. My Arlo and Ring Cams can display their live views and currently audio can be heard on the Show. I am confident we will see two way audio as with the original Echo (Original owner since day 1) I have witnessed excellent improvements and new features constantly being added to these devices!Highly recommend if you want voice control with a visual interface.

B01J24C0TI	Great device. Love it.	This is my 4th "Alexa" device. I also own a Google Home. The Amazon Echo line does a better job integrating with various home automation devices at the moment, which is great. The voice recognition is very good, but it uses Bing instead of Google (unfortunately) so the answers to some of the internet searches are not as good as they could be. Equivalent questions asked of Google Home produce more useful, more complete and/or more appropriate answers. The sound quality when playing music is very good. It's nice how it shows the lyrics to songs that are playing.  If the search engine could be switched to Google, this and all Echo devices would be the ultimate -- now they're only the best.	Tim P.

B01J24C0TI	Not there yet....	For now, it is an interesting device that has great potential. I will never use it for video calls... so that has no use to me. However, its inability to provide answers to simple questions via the Web, makes it somewhat limited. As new abilities are written for it I suspect it will become a more compelling device. If I had to do it all over again, I think I would wait to purchase it until it could do more useful things. As it is, it does little more that the Dot.

The problem I have been having is when I try to search for something on wikipedia and it doesn't seem to have any internet search functions which would be nice.  Not that I know of at least, I've been studying it and still can't figure it out.  I was hoping it would do more than play music.  It also doesn't give me access to Amazon.com to order things, or look up order history to reorder things.  This I was hoping was part of the functions, it only gives us Alexa's Deals about 10 items.

One issue I experienced was when asking the 2017 MLB All-Star game score, and it couldn't verbally tell me. But in screen it showed it was 1-1 in the 9th. I asked my Google home, and it knew without issue.That said, I'll update my review when the "show" features appear to be worth the price tag. If this was $100 less I'd have given a 5 star rating out of the gate.	Jesse	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2JG800NNSF136/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	3	2017/07/12

B01J24C0TI	It's getting there...	Getting there, but needs a better UI to be a killer device.The good:The hardware is awesome. The speakers in it sound great, and the touch screen produces sharp images and the response time feels fast and accurate. The video calling function also produces nice and clear video calls.The not-so-good:The user interface is a little wonky.  If I'm listening to something on the device and get a phone call or some other sort of interruption, the device doesn't properly resume what I was listening to. If my news flash briefing is interrupted, then it won't resume playing, and when I ask it to resume my flash briefing it starts over from the beginning. Also, navigating through the device doesn't appear to be fully baked yet. Sure, I can ask the device to pull up certain videos on YouTube, but it would be much easier if there were a YouTube app that I could scroll through so I could choose from videos of which I don't know the precise name of. There's a beautiful touchscreen on the thing and Amazon has provided few ways of actually using it. Ideally there would be apps available on a home screen, and not hidden somewhere behind a series of voice commands. It would be so nice if the thing had a ton of apps so I could easily pick something from Netflix or Hulu, or a recipe app.The on screen suggestions are also a little annoying. I don't need a collection of banners that read "Ask Alexa to play John Mayer songs", or "Ask Alexa to tell me more about Rob Kardashian's Twitter Meltdown". I would like to have the option of a photo slideshow when the thing is not in use. Right now it just cycles through these annoying banners.I have faith in Amazon though. I hope/predict that a ton of apps are coming down the pike, and that they will be available on some type of GUI.

B01J24C0TI	The sound quality is very good. It gives a nice rich sound for watching ...	The setup process for the Echo Show was a little quirky -- more so than other Echo devices I've setup (I have an Echo, 6 Dots, and 2 Shows).  I had to restart it and connect to the network several times, but once setup, I've been impressed.  I have it in my home office and play movies from Amazon Prime Videos while working.  The sound quality is very good.  It gives a nice rich sound for watching movies.  Pausing a video will cause it to stop in just a few seconds.  It would be nice to persist on the pause screen longer (until dismissed).I have played around with the calling capabilities a bit, but it is not a primary driver feature for me.I ordered a couple of items on Amazon PrimeDay from the Echo Show and the process was super simple.  It gave me more confidence seeing the product I'm ordering rather than voice ordering from my Echo / Echo Dot (as I've done in the past).Now that Echo has a display, I would love to see some apps available for home automation, like visual control for my Hue lights or an app for my Ecobee thermostat.  When Echo/Sonos integration is finally released, I'd definitely like a Show Sonos Music control app.Finally, I'd like more control over the screensaver, like being able to turn off the "Try.." suggestions altogether, instead of just limiting the scope.  I'm an experienced Echo user and don't want to be persuaded to watch "Dora the Explorer".

B01J24C0TI	Definitely recommend for my purposes!	Some history first: I had a home automation system installed about a year ago that included two intercoms with video monitors. We have had only problems with this system that was off-line far more than it was working as advertised! I ordered two Echo Shows in desperation and they are working very well! The only time the intercom in my husbands workshop didn't work was when he needed the power cord to test something else he was working on. Once plugged back in it was back online instantly. It was necessary to create a new amazon account for my husband and list his account as part of my "household." Now when I need to talk to him I just ask Alexa to call him! Works great! I also like that I can view the cameras, the ones that I installed and are not part of the automation system. It works pretty well but is a bit slow initiating. Whether that's Echo or the cameras themselves, I haven't delved into as yet.All the other function of this Alexa work as advertised but strangely I find I use it far more than the Echo dots that I have in various rooms throughout the house.For my needs, this has been the perfect solution! I am now talking with an audio visual expert to remove the entire home automation system and install something (still to be determined) that works through the Alexa app.	RetiredAndLovingIt	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AUTJ8J0UYE5V7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/12

B01J24C0TI	It could be a very useful product and has a lot of potential	It could be a very useful product and has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the bugs in the outdated Alexa App make this product almost useless if you want to use it outside the United States. I live in Italy 🇮🇹 and if you ever read the story that humans use only about 30 percent of their brain capabilities, the exact same issue applies to Echo Show outside the US. For a bug (that I hope will be fixed very soon) there is no way that I can set the device location in the Ethernal City of Rome. Therefore, asking: "Alexa, what is the weather like today?" You will hear all sorts of meteorological information regarding Seattle or some other US city. Welcome Amazon to the age of globalization!!!

It comes in handy checking out my flash briefing's in the morning with visuals and searching for Youtube videos without needing to use my hands or my phone. Best part, I don't have to buy a separate chrome cast device like you need with Google home to watch videos. It's only $50 more than the large echo and it's totally worth it. Noise cancellation built into the speakers definitely helps with picking up my voice when music is blasting!

B01J24C0TI	Visionary	Works just as well as the normal Echo tower, and sounds great.  Even some of the Flash Briefing providers are now adding video to their narrative (e.g. Kiro 7).We have one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom.  I've set the "do not disturb" mode on a schedule on the bedroom one, so that it always dims when we're going to bed with no little headlines, and brightens up in the morning, with little snippets of things to ask.  I would say that although it does dim appropriately, the do not disturb mode could be one step dimmer.One suggestion I have, is that the home screen shows the current time and weather, but also needs to show the date.  No doubt an update will fix that soon.	P. Elliott	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A3MM7ZRHV5QWFH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/07/12

B01J24C0TI	Disappointing...No search or sign in on YouTube, SiriusXM app doesn't work	As some reviews have said, the Echo Show is not ready for prime time. I received mine and was happy with it until I began trying out different features that I thought worked. For example, in YouTube. I cannot sign in or search videos. I will ask for YouTube meditation videos and get the same top rated on each request. The ones I want which are in my subscriptions are unable because I can't sign in, search or access my notifications or subscriptions. The other issue I had was that I was unable to use the SiriusXM app with the Show.I contacted customer service thinking I was not doing something right. They told me they were working on the SiriusSM issue and would add mine to the list. What was interesting was they couldn't understand why I would want to be able to sign into YouTube, search and access videos that I actually enjoy instead of the same top rated videos delivered with my request to the Show.It's a neat gadget. I like the fact that I could see the videos on YouTube, but I want to see what I want not what Amazon deems important for me to watch.Also, the Show has a problem understanding requests. The Echo seems to do better, just barely. I can't stand when the Echo and Show light up as if it is going to do something with the request and just shuts right off without a word. I thought it would operate like a tablet, but the keyboard doesn't come up on YouTube. It's just a disappointment based on what you're getting for your money.	jwillin	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2T8RF1M95ZCZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	2	2017/07/12

B01J24C0TI	Time to start the Show	I received my Echo Show securely packaged and on time as usual with Amazon Prime.  Upon unboxing, setup was seamless and simple.  Following a few prompts and within minutes I was in business and being serviced by Alexa with the benefit of the visuals provided by the screen.Anyone familiar at this point with any of the Echo devices will already know what to expect, however with this device you have the added benefit of seeing your results real-time.  Sync your calendar and see daily prompts of schedules and events, Setup your news feeds and see them scroll across as you glance at this device.The speaker, although unidirectional, has a rich sound and is fairly loud in all directions considering.  Music, as well as Alexa's, prompts sound rich and clear from anywhere in my downstairs area where this device is located. Making video calls as well as contact calls (with those with Echo devices) is quick, simple and easy with this unit.  Just note that other users will either need an Echo device or the Alexa app on their phone in order to make or receive calls.The video presentations on this unit are rich and clear as well, no matter watching streaming video via the web or video calling.  I am patiently awaiting more security camera add-ons and connectivity to make this device a larger piece of my automated home.

If I spend good money for an iphone, a Sony TV, ipad, tablet, an echo show....whatever visual expensive device... .... I do not want to see ongoing "branded" suggestions about how to use the product, constant brand notes, etc. on my main screen..After talking to THREE Amazon support staff who generally had no clue or even access to internal helps on the Show, I found the setting to turn off the strange other oddly named "cards" or whatever, but still stuck with "Suggestions" not relevant to our life or use of the product.  Good product becomes an expensive advertising billboard of Amazon suggestions.  Fixit or train your staff on how to help. Still waiting for way to turn off so we can enjoy the basics of: time, temp and random favorite photos we uploaded to Amazon photos cloud service.UPDATE 2017 07 11.Dedicated Echo support reached out and we had a discussion as to my experiences and hopes.Paraphrased feedback from Amazon associate:Yes, the Echo Show continues to have resources devoted to updating/tweaking/fixing and both internal customers and the paying public can look forward to notification on the Show when the WIP software update is finished within a month or two.  Within that update, the annoying "Tips" and "Suggestions", which currently cannot be turned off, will be dealt with.  Also, the internal help documents are being modified and internally available with the on-going maturity of the device.I look forward to the changes.

For that purpose it is okay, but the limited functionality currently availble for the touch screen is frustrating.  Also it seems the old echo devices either had better michrophones or better recognition.... simple voice commands seem to be misunderstood often. Utlimately this is a work in progress device and I believe that Amazon will be working to get this up to speed.What few must have enhancements to make this device more user friendly:1. A simple clock/alarm app.  You still need to use voice or the cell phone app to create an alarm.  It would also be nice to customize the clock size and color.2. Amazon App???  If you want me to buy I need to be able to browse and serch visually.3. Ulitmaltey a couple of function buttons and on screen apps to make this function more like a cell phone or tablet.

B01J24C0TI	Awesome device, sadly customer support is not.	Firstly, I was an early adopter of echo in the invitation only days. I have been actively providing feedback to Amazon to try to make it better from day one. The device has weird issues and some missing features that you'd expect out of the box. I have attempted to provide Amazon with the standard feedback as always but they keep sending me canned responses or responses that show me that no one is actually reading or understanding anything I tell them. The echo customer support used to be awesome, now however, sadly, it is broken. My review would be five stars if they fix their customer support.	David D.

B01J24C0TI	... number of Echo devices and have always been very satisfied. However	I have a number of Echo devices and have always been very satisfied. However, the Show contains an annoyance that I just can't get past. I've turned off trending topics and notifications in Home Card Pereferences and still get constant annoying messages to try this and try that. I don't want to Wiki Star Trek nor do I want to ask Alexa what another word for Happy is. Seriously??!!All I want on my home screen is for it to scroll thru my own pics (and this works) and then display the time and temperature...no suggestions to try asking Alexa things I don't care about. All these suggestions just clutter the screen to the point where the automatic scrolling thru my own pics looses it's appeal as I barely see the pics thru the suggestions that clutter the screen.  If they don't create an option to get rid of all the junk soon with a software update, this thing goes back.	L.

B01J24C0TI	The screen adds little to Home Automation products except for Arlo.  Needs ability to view web pages.  Disappointing.	After spending a week with the Show, I am wanting so much more.  I primarily purchased it for use with home automation products like SmartThings, Ring Video Doorbell, Arlo cameras, and Hue bulbs.  The video screen adds little to most of these products, except for Arlo.SmartThings:You can control SmartThings devices just like with a traditional Echo, but you cannot view statuses of window/door sensors, or control thermostats, etc on the screen.  I would love to see this added in the future and was expecting this at launch.Ring Video Doorbell:Probably the biggest disappointment.  I was expecting to be able to view and talk to people when they ring my doorbell.  Nope.  It won't show the video (apparently it isn't supported for the non-Pro version yet), and you cannot speak with the visitor on ANY Ring device.  Huge bummer, it was a big reason I purchased the Shows.Arlo cameras:It is very convenient to be able to view my Arlo cameras on the Show.  It works pretty well.  Images come up fairly quickly on my network when I ask to view a specific camera.  This was what most apps should have been like at launch.Hue bulbs:Again, no use of the screen when controlling Hue bulbs.  Why not show a color wheel, etc for selecting colors?Also, there is currently no way to turn off the constant barrage of tips and tricks like "Try this" and "Try that" on the screen.  It doesn't work with Google Music.  It doesn't answer questions very well unless you install an unsupported, hacky way of Googling.  For example, I asked Alexa "does Radon gas have an odor?" and it started reading me a news story about fuel in Germany.  Tried again, same thing.  I asked my Google Home as well as the unsupported Ask Google skill that takes awhile to install, and it immediately answered my question thoroughly.A huge feature would be the ability to view web pages on the Show.  That would allow me to control SmartThings and the Ring like I want to.  There is a hidden web browser on the Show, but it doesn't have an address bar so you can't specify where to go.Overall, it could be so much better.  Time will tell if I keep them or sell them on Ebay.	Juniorverse1	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2KOV8XWZOZ0FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	3	2017/07/09

B01J24C0TI	Great, but can still get better with a few tweaks.	The Echo Show takes what you'd expect from the original Echo and expands upon it by adding a screen and a camera.  The screen is bright and sharp, and while not many skills take advantage of it (which is understandable considering Alexa is a voice-based service), the ones that do, provide some useful information such as news headlines, song lyrics, and weather forecasts and details such as humidity.  The home screen can display a slideshow based on photos stored on Prime Photos.The sound quality is acceptable, but seems to have more of an emphasis on the mids and lacks some clarity in the highs that while the Echo isn't particularly good at either, still does better than the Show.  The Show does get plenty loud enough for my uses without distracting amounts of distortion though.The Show's wifi performance seems a bit spotty, with the flash briefing seemingly having several second delays between each headline or the start of a podcast compared to the Echo, and even occasionally drops the wifi connection all together even though other devices remain connected without issue.The built in camera can take still photos by asking Alexa to take a picture, where Alexa will then ask for your camera options before snapping the shot.  I was pleasantly surprised at the photo quality, though the resolution isn't particularly high.The show's microphone array seems to have better hearing in general than the Echo, though occasionally it picks up what it thinks is the wake word even though nothing remotely like it was spoken.The screen dims when nobody is nearby and will come back on when someone is spotted on the camera.  The camera, like the microphone is always watching, but not broadcasting unless you're in a call for this to work, and like the microphones, can be turned on or off with a button.Annoyingly though, for now, there is no way to disable the tips that flash upon the screen, interspersed among news headlines and weather updates.  There also does not appear to be a way to set the clock to use 24 hour time, nor specify AM/PM on the display.  You cannot specify the slideshow cycle time, nor select multiple albums to choose slideshow pictures.  The ability to pick news sources or RSS feeds to display on the home screen would be nice.

B01J24C0TI	Highly recommended	I read some of the other reviews and I guess it all comes down to what you are looking for. I have an Amazon Echo in the bedroom and the Show in the kitchen. I find it is everything it is advertised to be, and more. The setup is so easy I have watched 2 tech-noobs successfully do it in minutes. (These people constantly ask me things like "how do I find settings on my phone?").The customer service is just amazing. You call the help number given in the app and in a couple of minutes, you have a live person on the phone who goes the extra mile to get the right answer. I called a few times to get answers on some how-to things, like "can Alexa handle double-authentication on wifi - answer is yes). The rep double-checked with one of their wifi experts before giving me the answer. I also had a problem with the message notification bubble not appearing on my screen. Turns out I had to remove the middle initial from my registration name. I was surprised she figured that out so quickly.The screen is sharp and clear and I can easily read everything without my reading glasses. The prime music/video and youtube integrations are excellent and be sure to take a look at using the tunein application which offers some interesting podcasts and news. I like how, when I set a timer, it keeps going off until I dismiss it. I do wish you could personalize how many times Alexa gives you a reminder in case you are out of the room. Right now she tells you twice but the reminder is also displayed on the screen for a while.I am finding new cool things that Alexa can do everyday and I have no doubt that future updates will add more. If you are looking for a device that is compatible with Chromecast, this isn't for you. But if you are looking for a personal assistant that can make your life easier and add a bit humor (through easter eggs), I highly recommend it.

B01J24C0TI	Really great product but it's not ready for prime time	Really great product but it's not ready for prime time, the software looks more like a beta version, still missing a lot of basic features and settings. Yo can't change the info on the home screen,  Another HUGE issue is that only works with a US address, our company has an office in South America and another one in Europe and I usually work in those offices a few months a year and the Echo Show is a big NO if you try to use it oversees, I work for a tech company so I know it's extremely easy for Amazon to allow to enter a city or state that is not in the US for the local weather and other features. I will change my review to 5 stars once they fix all these issues and they make the OS more user friendly and allow us to fully customize the home screen and other features to better suit our needs.Oh I almost forgot to mention that the sound is pretty good for a small device.

Update: from 2 starts to 4 stars:Update.... gear S3 (not sure with other smartwatch)  + samsung galaxy s8+ (not sure with other phones)  will make your video call on echo show  unable to route sound to phone speaker. You will end up having to listen through the regular handset speaker (which means you have to put the phone against your ear) to hear the other party. I have to turn off bluetooth, or turn off smart watch, or disable audio call on the bluetooth setting for the samrt watch in order to be able to use speaker phone capabilities when making video call to amazon echo show. This needs to be fixed, if fixed, it will be 5 stars.  Otherwise, echo show is awesome.old review:No speaker phone capabilities on drop in call app? Really?

The Tips are in the way and need to have a option to turn them off.  Second the speaker is not at good as the orginal echo this replaced.

B01J24C0TI	Great product for keeping in touch with elderly parents!	This is a brilliant product and even better than I had hoped.  I bought two so that I could check in frequently with my 90-year-old mother in another state.  Setup was surprisingly easy - just plugged it in and connected the Wi-Fi.  It has several advantages for this kind of application over a tablet.  First it's entirely voice controlled, so that once my mom learned to say "Alexa" before each command, she was able to access all kinds of information and make calls to family with just her voice.  No tablet to find, no buttons to push - just talking.  I'm able to easily make video calls to my mom with my iphone from anywhere.  It was also easy to connect a Google calendar to her Echo Show so that she could keep track of upcoming events.  She lives in a senior community and has short-term memory issues, so this help with keeping track of upcoming events is very useful.  We used the shopping list function and it worked beautifully - letting her add things to her list when she thought of them and then checking them off on her android phone at the store.  The speaker is great too.  She can ask for Glen Miller music and get a nice selection of favorite songs or she can ask for a preview of a movie she's heard about from TV, as well as getting movie times and locations.  In addition to using our own Echo Show for these things, my wife and I have both our calendars synced to it, so we know what events are coming up.  I can't say enough good things about it and I'm grateful to Amazon for bringing it to market and using the knowledge they've gained from the Echo to good effect.

They did agree with the review and added it to the things we talked about to go to the developers.  There are a lot of phrases you need to precede or follow up with to make it recognize certain words even though what you say is not incorrect. i'm seriously impressed with the staff and that they care to improve this to that extent.  We tried a few things they suggested for commands to access some of this prim content but they didn't work for me.  she recognized what I said but they just didn't work.  Some people it seems have issues with some things I don't and vise versa.  I love troubleshooting, but not at the cost of my money so for now i'm not changing my review.. but I give the staff 5 stars [End of edit]This is going to sound like i'm defending this product but i'll be honest with you all, i'm very dis-satisfied with it for many reasons.  However, I want to help.  I doubt anyone from the company that has anything to do with the development will ever pay attention to this but in the chance that they do, it's worth the effort.I'll Be as concise as possible with this review because there is so much to talk about.First of all,  What the Echo Show is NOT...1. it is NOT meant to be a tablet.2. It's NOT supposed to be something that is portable like a tablet or a phone.First The good...1. It's really high quality in hardware2. It looks professional3. it's heavy enough and non slide so that you are not likely to knock it down.4. The video quality is really nice for it's size screen and my eyes don't hurt watching it.5. I have never once had an issue with voice recognition.  NOT ONCE.  Most of the time I do have issues with things like that due to my southern accent but I have never had to repeat something to Alexa due to her not understanding it.  I have had to due to using the wrong words but that is not Alexa's fault.6. They really did an amazing job for an AI so early on for a product like this when it comes to interactions like saying good morning to her.  Could they have made it into something you would see in a movie? sure in time, but this is not a hollywood-ized product.7.  I really like the concept of adding skills to customize her like you like even though there are not many very good ones ... YET.8. The face to face talking is nice.. like bringing skype to the echo devices.9. The mic sensitivity is amazing.  alexa can hear me 2 large open rooms away.Now the Maddening BAD that I have high hopes that they will improve on.1. All the investing I have done in Amazon's services and The Echo Show doesn't use them!!!!  The Cloud service, amazon prime video, and the one it does use, amazon music,  it's so limited you might as well not even have it.  it doesn't compete with any of the other services out there.  They tried .. sort of ... it's a start?  if you want to pull up a single song or the front page of youTube you are okay then.  But that isn't enough for me.  I have paid for my services and yet I can't use them in an amazon device that would be rather simple to use through a device like that!  I paid more than a price of a tablet that can do 100x more than this can with amazon services.2. Amazon, don't tell people you can send a text or call people on your phone contacts and not tell the whole truth.  What they don't tell you is that supposedly your contacts have to be on your phone locally for alexa to see it..  However, THAT isn't even true... they not only have to be contacts on your phone but also have the echo app. Your advertising is misleading!  if you want people to put your app on their phones that don't have any echo product , you need to find a way other than buying your product to get people to WANT to. Find a better way to present it for crying out loud.  The app is very clunky at best and definitely not intuitive.  And if you don't have an echo product most of it isn't going to make much sense to them to even have !3. I realize you as the company want people to buy from you as much as possible... but you aren't going to get people to love alexa and the echo if you ram everything you sell down people's throats.  take off the dang ads on the display, the constant movement, give people a chance to make it like they want, ... it's extremely distracting and totally NOT usable in a bedroom.  too bright and constantly flashing around and lighting up the room.4. This product has so much potential but it's like you crammed a clunky phone app in this nice piece of hardware that looks so amazing and totally cheapened the experience and made us alpha testers.... that HAD to pay to get the experience.  I would test this product till my voice is raw and with pride if I didn't have to pay for this early version as if it was a several year old tested product.  I don't mind paying for good product.  But I bought two of these and I felt like i could have bought two tablets and got a LOT more functionality out of it.5. Seriously in need to filter some of the skills on the app as well... some of them are just horrible and hold alexa up so bad with no ability to exit that you have to turn it off just to get out of it.6. No touch menu ability... well ... you touch the thing to confirm to turn it off.  >,<  There is one or two other places I found you could in a limited way. You need some way to get the heck out of the apps without turning it off one some of those skills.... or be able to browse the music or videos you should be able to access or currently can!There are so many other good and bad points to this product but I just don't ahve teh time and honestly i'm giving Amazon my time for free to do this.  I really am an amazon fan.  even tried to apply for a job once that required a master's degree at least..so i'm extremely disappointed in the product that is part of a product line that is part of their branding.now.  please amazon.. don't throw that away.  I won't send the product back because hardware wise there is nothing wrong with it, but i wish I hadn't spent my money on the two Echo Shows all the same.  There are very few businesses I believe in anymore...and I don't want to stop believing in this one.  we all mess up,  I just ask you make this right with a product I would be proud to offer if it were mine.. isn't that what you are supposed to be about?  I know you are very large now compared to 1994 starting in that garage, but don't have to lose the integrity of that garage business.  Love amazon, love the lines, and love how you make my life much easier and higher quality with the services.Create an awesome day for yourselves.~ish	ishKiia	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2HTDXRUJP6JGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	13	2	2017/07/08

B01J24C0TI	As Revolutionary as Original Echo!	For a first generation device with no competition in sight, this product is a conceptual breakthrough. Five years from now, this will the way in which most computer interactions will take place. I expect five years from now, this will be the television that we use, only we will "touch" the screen with a video pointer of some kind.Solves a lot of problems with audio-only communication. For example, want to hear deals of the day? No, you want to see them and scroll through. The order by number. Every wanted to know the lyrics to the song. Look at the screen.Can only imagine this getting better and better, but we have to compare this all the alternative ways currently available. Is this a lot better than audio tools like original echo and all the new competitors? Yes, absolutely. Is this better than doing similar things on my tablet or computer? Yes, it is hands free. Screen is big enough to see and stands up in its own. Speaker is decent.Is there stuff to criticize? Yes, doesn't seem to have Bluetooth.

B01J24C0TI	Three Stars	too early to tell , has potential to be a hit	Maureen L	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A3NW6GFOE8WNM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2017/07/07
B01J24C0TI	It has extreme potential	So first off, let me start by saying, I am, and my family, are all Apple everything. MacBook’s, Apple TVs, Watches, all iPhones, etc. You name it. We use it. But once I saw that the Echo Show had a screen I was so GAME, this was also after the HomePod from Apple was released (no screen). I wanted to try it out so badly, I have a few regular speakers but never bought a home smart speaker before, so this was entirely and completely new for me, and let me tell you, so far so GOOD.Just like Apple, the packaging was very nice, lots to open and unwrap, all clean and dust free. The set up was okay, it took a while but my Wi-Fi is not the best so It could have just been personal reasons. And once it turned on I was like, “uhhhh what do I do now”. It was just a screen and nothing really happened besides a little video beforehand on what it can do. I started to ask it questions and downloaded different skills and what not and it became easier to use.The quality of the auto is amazing, it gets very loud stays very clear. The 7in screen is also very high definition, as well as the 5MP front camera. I then downloaded the Alexa app and video chatted some people which was so awesome to do so in the kitchen as I was just cooking and cleaning, etc. It felt very futuristic.Now if you’re looking for something mind-blowing and life changing this is not for you. This is a massive step for the Echo devices and I am very happy to own one. It’s enjoyable and easy to use. The more skills you download the more I found out it can do so much more than I really thought. I like the news apps and the sound making apps.Aesthetically speaking it looks so sweet, clean and futuristic just sitting in my kitchen with the home screen always on and ready to be talked to. And I probably love that the most. Just a little "smart-home-TV-speaker" just chilling in my kitchen. This device and future ones have so much potential in the home and can really change the way we live. I really enjoy being an early adopter of technology to see which direction we are headed in and this is a great start.  Amazon is seriously killing the game and I am so excited for their future! Another PLEASED customer!!UPDATED- (7/12/17)-The Alexa app, sorry to say, but it's absolute garbage. The UI is okay but it has a lot going on and it isn't too helpful. It's very slow and when you tap some settings it says it doesn't work, or check your connection, etc. Every option you press on the app must load and buffer which is very annoying. They really need to fix and update the app because that's where you manage 100% of what you're doing on your Echo Show.- I wish it worked with Apple Music ha ha ha... wishful thinking. I know.- I love the “Do Not Disturb” setting. You can turn it on/off from your Echo Show and the Alexa app. I don’t want friends/family video chatting (dropping in) on me drunk at 2:00 am when I am sleeping.-I like that you can change the background home screen, but wish it was brighter. I can’t really see it too much.- “Voice Training” never works for me and I want it to work!

B01J24C0TI	It's Okay	It is basically an Echo like any other. But there are some cool things it can do with the screen. Unfortunately when it is not in use the screen just cycles through annoying crap.  Instead of all of that screen garbage I wish it would just go dark. Ideally you could set the screen preferences. I would like to see time, date, weather, temp, and next event on my calendar. That would make this 5 stars. I don't want to look over and see "NY shoe designer gets $5,000 for latest fashion line".  I could not care less!  After a software upgrade I will probably upgrade to 4 stars.  Get to work coding Amazon!	Andreas R. - D.

B01J24C0TI	Disappointed Fan	I was one of the early beta adopters of Echo and subsequently added 3 dots around the house. Control lighting, Sonos, Dyson and Nest devices and am addicted to voice OS. Thought I had to add the Show but after 2 weeks am disappointed. Sub-standard and spotty voice recogntion, no audio out, small screen that adds little and is too tethered for family video calls. I think its on the way to becoming part of my museum of misguided tech purchases	Ian Warfield	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A3S2R2LGQ3PEVV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	2	2017/07/07
B01J24C0TI	Not ready for prime time!	I have very much been looking forward to getting my Show, & bought two of them. However, I am FAR from being satisfied with its performance. I'm a professional engineer, with more than 50 years technology experience, & I have 18 Amazon devices listed under www.amazon.com/mycd, so I'm not exactly an amateur on their products. I also own a computer consulting company that has dealt with integrating audio, video, & computer networks for more than 30 years, & our home is very "smart."However, in the two days I have been running my Show, it has failed to respond to voice commands 19 times, so far. That includes simple ones, like "Alexa, Stop" & "Alexa, Continue." The unit is sitting 18 inches from me, so it's not like it's unable to pick up my voice, & when I switch back to my Alexa Echo, that unit works perfectly, as usual. Not only does the Show fail to respond, it also responds incorrectly, although fewer times. I find myself getting angry at an inanimate - but supposedly intelligent - object, which is not a good thing at all!I found that I cannot run both my Echo & Echo Show at the same time, at least not while they're sitting a few feet from each other, so I keep two Firefox tabs open so I can switch back & forth...usually because the Show has stopped responding.The video screen is a very nice feature, but there's no obvious way to return to a Home screen, except by just waiting. The touch-screen just...isn't touchable. In fact, the touch feature works so UNreliably, that I quit using it within an hour of setting up the Show, & I consider it useless. The pull-down menu gets you to commands, but there isn't any way to back up one level, & I found myself having to use the pull-down multiple times to get anything done, a very-inefficient way to accomplish anything.I contacted Amazon Technical Support to ask some questions, & it was painfully obvious that their technicians have no idea how to provide service advice for the Show; one tech disappeared for almost 20 minutes before I got fed up, & closed the Chat session. I have sent several e-mails asking how to identify non-Amazon smartphones so that I can use the Alexa app to communicate, but have received nothing that makes any sense, almost as if they're answering a totally different question.One good thing is that setting up the Show was utterly painless, & has been the most-useful feature I've found so far. It took me less than 10 minutes, including the multiple software updates & reboots the device went through. The Show's speakers are marginally better than the Echo's, but not as "room-filling" as their advertising led me to believe.In short, perhaps the software updates will make the Show into a device that I can rely upon, but it's not at all ready for prime time right now! So, instead of sending the second Show as a gift to my sister (who has no experience with Amazon's voice-operated devices), I will hold onto it for now, just in case I have to return both units. I have 28 more days to make that decision, &, regretfully, I think it's a toss-up. I'll come back & revisit these comments over the next few weeks, just in case I'm pleasantly surprised.UPDATES: I just took away a star! I've had the Show for not quite a week, & I am pretty sure that I'm going to return both of them to Amazon. I've been keeping a list of problems & observations, as follows:Need to be able change music lyrics font sizeLoss of music station multiple times (Echo plays okay)Multiple instances of "Something has gone wrong"Multiple instances of "What do you want to play?" after "Alexa, Stop"After turning on Smart Home, Alexa says it's not on, so no camera availableAt 10:03 PM on 7/11/17, despite me almost screaming at the Show five or six times, it would NOT stop, & I had to use the application on my computer to make the extremely loud commercial pause! This is totally unacceptable! Then, when I tried to restart the music, the Show told me that the station was unavailable, when I could get it to play on the Echo, right beside it, & the Windows app could no longer connect to the Show.The Show responds only randomly to the app on the computer, sometimes ignoring it completely, other times responding after seconds, or even minutesWhy have a touch-screen, when 99% of the gestures don't work?The Show should be able to show the name of the song that's playingThe Show continues to stop arbitrarily for no reason at all, & will not restart on the same music station; this isn't happening with the EchoNOTE: I did get a phone call from an Amazon tech support person after I wrote my first negative review, which means that they are very interested in user feedback, & he agreed with all of the problems I mentioned, telling me that they are "working to resolve them." That is, frankly, the ONLY reason that I haven't packaged these up & sent them back! My computer company has been doing beta-testing for more than 30 years, & I feel it only fair to give Amazon the full 30 days to get these problems resolved, but I'm sure not seeing any sign of things getting better!Having music & other features stopping arbitrarily, having blaring commercials that CANNOT be shut down, & having a device that ignores its own app are all problems that MUST be fixed!! It's not bad enough that computers can drive me crazy - I don't have to put up with a voice-activated device that refuses to listen, too!	Kenneth M.

B01J24C0TI	It has potential as a video streaming device	This device has a lot of potential especially in regards to using it as a video capture or streaming device. I walked up to the Amazon Show and said "Alexa start recording" half-heartedly expecting her to say okay. It would be a pretty cool feature if you had a kitchen show or you just wanted to shoot a quick video blog to Facebook or even live stream from the Amazon show to Facebook live or Instagram live.I think you could also use it as a video capture device for Twitch Streaming. It would be great if it could double as a webcam to record you and then it would seemlessly integrate with a twitch stream from a console game or a phone game that you might be streaming and then automatically overlay your face onto the game for people to see just as if you had a webcam.

B01J24C0TI	I LOVE the ECHO - so I bought the SHOW to ...	I don't write many reviews - but I hadn't seem one similar to what I experienced.  I LOVE the ECHO - so I bought the SHOW to put kitchen - which is where I had originally placed my ECHO.  I do love the SHOW as well - but I don't feel that the speakers are better or at the same level as the ECHO.  I have seen many reviews that say sound quality excellent and better then the ECHO.  However, I don't "hear" that.  So maybe the speakers are in fact better, but I feel they are not.  I have quite a collection of audio devices through my homes, cars and have dedicated media rooms for theatre style viewing - so, while I don't consider myself an expert - I think I can bring substance to my review.  I love the SHOW, if I didn't have the ECHO, it would be 5 stars - but part of me is considering sending back and purchasing another ECHO.  The other note that I would like mention is that on my flash briefings (which I love) - on my SHOW, I experience a fluctuation in volume depending on the POD cast - which is odd, because I am not experiencing the same type of volume fluctuation with the ECHO.  I namely notice this on the ESPN Mark Schlereth show from Denver, CO (spelling and name of skill could be off).  Is anyone else experiencing the same thing?	Mark S.

B01J24C0TI	Echo Show is GREAT for video calling.	I pre-ordered two of these a couple of months ago, and have had them on deck for about a week now, one in my son's home in PHX and one in my home in Utah.I bought them primarily for the video calling and messaging functions. After a couple of calls between the two units, I can say that I'm satisfied that my reason for buying has been justified. Call quality was excellent; no breakup (pixelation) such as Skype calls are afflicted with, decent video resolution, no voice/video sync issues, no lag. Works better than I expected for this function. A minor niggle under CONS. A secondary reason I wanted the SHOW is for viewing my five Arlo cams on demand. This also works well enough, though the skill could use a little tuning. I'm sure that will happen. The only issue with it is that there is some delay while "Connecting to Netgear", which can't be blamed on the Echo. Same thing happens when checking cams from my phone, or even from my DT which is in the same room as the Arlo hub (with both hardwired via Ethernet.) Also a Netgear issue is that it sometimes takes more than one try to connect to a camera. Netgear should probably try to fix this issue, it's longstanding. But I digress. The skill COULD display multiple cameras at once, as you see on the phone app and the web app. But it doesn't. Maybe someday. Other pros and cons, subject to revision after the device SW and skills mature:PROS:YouTubeLyrics onscreen when playing from Prime MusicPhoto slideshow from your Prime Photos as a homescreen background, if you wantSpeakers are very decent for voice and quite decent for music (also a CON; see below.)Can display calendar appointments on demand (Google Calendar used.)Drop-In feature works well for room-to-room intercom.Seems to reconnect & become usable more quickly than tall Echos and Dots when unplugged & moved.Solidly built, pleasing aesthetic (I bought black.)Bright screen, touch sensitivity a little low for me...an adjustment in settings would be nice.CONS:Speakers (also a Pro; see above.) The speakers are very directional, covering the 180 degree arc in front of the SHOW well, but sound quality drops dramatically as soon as the listener moves to the side or rear of the unit. This primarily affects music quality. If it's up against a wall or in a corner, should be fine, but we keep ours on the kitchen counter which is open to great room, and behind the device music is thin, flat, watery. To be expected, I guess, with speakers oriented toward a screen viewer. We've been spoiled by the sound from the tall Echos. One located in the center of the great room provides excellent coverage throughout that area and the kitchen as well, with no directional blind spots. Definitely our choice for music. Stick with the tall Echo for great streamed or BT music. We rarely use our Bose BT or the Big Jambox we've had for years anymore...Echo tall is that good. As good as Bose/Big Jambox? No, not quite, but very close. Besides, if you want to use your favorite BT music speaker paired with the SHOW, you certainly can.Home screen: Inability to have granular control over what's displayed on HOME screen. I HATE that SHOW rotates through a bunch of unwanted and unneeded suggestions on what to ask Alexa, overprinted onto my chosen BG images (photo slideshow.) LET US TURN THAT OFF! I called Amazon CS, and the guy was great, spent about 30 minutes with me, but neither of us could turn it off. Minor niggle...the screen darkened during a lengthy video call as part of SHOW's screensaver logic, and I couldn't get it to brighten again without rebooting after the call. Amazon should definitely write into the OS so that the screen NEVER darkens when a video call is in process. How hard can that be? Also, I read that the inactivity screen darkening is supposed to see new activity around the device and brighten again on approach; it's flaky, unreliable at present. Needs a tune-up.ALL IN ALL, I'm happy with the purchase, but here's a REALLY, REALLY BIG THING for Amazon, and one that would send the sales of ALL Echo devices through the roof, and probably kill the Google Home to boot: Being able to listen to a music stream on all or selected multiple devices throughout the house. Goggle Home can do this. Right now we have two tall Echos, three Dots, and one Show. If Amazon would enable synced music streaming, I would have a device in every room, and as a side benefit to Amazon, I might subscribe to Prime Unlimited Music instead of just using the free Prime Music.I'm sure I'll have updates after a few more weeks of use. BTW, I've had two SW updates not including the initial one on first boot, so I know they're working on stuff.

B01J24C0TI	Alexa is Part of the Family	The Echo Show is better than all the other Alexa products combined! I have mine set on my kitchen counter where I can get the news and the weather in the morning or recipes for dinner. I love being able use the touch screen to view my lists and other information without having to get my phone app out. Even the voice response seems to better understand what I am saying. The video screen makes keeping track of my calendar a breeze too. Video calling is so much easier without having to hold my phone if I am busy doing other things.My only wish would be a for a Home button and other touch to start icons (calendar, weather, etc) on the home screen. There are times I would like to view something without speaking and risk waking the house. But I understand this is not a phone or a computer and all in all I love this so much that I ordered one for a friend.

B01J24C0TI	Does not offer mush over the original Echo	It is ok but not really more functional than my original Echo, I plan to slowly integrate my home automaton into my Alexa app and for the most part its works as it should, however they are not leveraging the screen very well at this point.

B01J24C0TI	it's just not quite there yet	We love Echo. We thought we would love Echo Show, but somehow its hardware isn't quite the same: it doesn't recognize our voices as well, it's a bit slower, the display doesn't really add anything (e.g., when I ask for my commute time, where's the map?). I thought it would be great because I do research in the area of spoken dialogue and I've been pursuing visual interfaces like this so it might make for a decent research platform (though making skills for Alexa Video is less developed than Alexa proper). Despite that, my family doesn't like the show.I don't like that it keeps showing ads and updates that I could NOT care less about. I keep one in my office but I have to point it somewhere else because all of the changes keep catching my eye. If it had more targeted information for me I would probably use it more. I've also been completely unable to have my office Echo Show connect via video with my home Echo Show. I've had success from the phone app to either of the devices, but they don't work together. So far, it's been a disappointment. It's a really expensive Echo. I give it two stars because at least it does stuff that Echo does.

B01J24C0TI	The Show is not ready for prime time	We have a couple of Echo's which work well, and respond quickly to play song requests, etc.  The Show, unfortunately, does not respond quickly and is unable to carry out many of its basic function, like read the news, play a SiriusXM channel, or play Amazon music.  Clearly it needs some sort of update to make it work better.The registration process was clunky, and would not initially take my registration, but did so after a "reboot" (i.e. I unplugged it in frustration).  It seems to have a problem with WiFi in that it would not connect to my 5GHz signal but it did to the 2.4 GHz signal.  I would prefer that we have the ability to change certain settings in the Alexa app, but those appear to be relegated to the unit itself, and I have not taken the time to figure out how to do that configuration.As for SiriusXM, it does not seem to be able to consistently play stations, giving me a "sorry but I cant seem to be able to play music" error.  Half the time it can't find the channel I ask for as well.Needs work, and I might just bring down my Echo from the upstair back downstairs until they work out the bugs.

B01J24C0TI	Great addition to Echo - wish I'd gotten one for my son. We have iPhones and iPads but this is voice controlled more smoothly...	Came out at a perfect time - our 26th anniversary said pictures were the gift for that year so I loaded all our 19.000 photos on it and now they can be streamed at will with a simple voice command. I love this improvement to the Echo products. It's made Siri obsolete in my book. I've never had it say, "I'll tap you when I'm ready," when I asked it to do something. Alexa is definitely the leader in technological development.	MEW	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A9WRLOZQHHXE5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	5	2017/07/06

B01J24C0TI	Updated my rating I was able to get my arlo pro cameras working with the Show with help of Alexa support	I Ignored the mediocre reviews because I wanted this product to be great and ordered a 2 pack.  Set the first unit up looking to use two of the skills.  1.) Video call to a person with Alexa app (FAIL - even though they have the Alexa app open and it's ringing from my end for a video call, receiver shows no activity and ultimately 'person unavailable').2.) Arlo camera viewing (FAIL - devices are recognized under smart devices but when asking the Show to display, all it can say is 'Nursery doesn't support that'So far a waste of money, stick with the basic Echo or dot.

B01J24C0TI	Won't blow away your tablet - wonderful for the physically disabled.	I'd like to start by saying that The Show was a gift. I also own an Alexa and The Dot.PRO's* The Show has a large base and it will not fall over easily and its impossible for it to fall over on its own.* The Show appears to be solidly built although I am skeptical as to whether it could survive a fall.* If packed well, could be ideal for travel as you can have an alarm clock, weather and Prime Shows and movies to watch.* The speaker has a rich tones - audiophiles may not be happy (see below) but this is a hifi device.* Setup is easy and The Show only has three buttons - its quite user friendly.CONS* This kills me - no 3.5mm jack! So, if you opt to use the video chat feature there is no privacy - external speakers only.* All audio and video chats etc are saved on Amazon's cloud for the purpose of improving the device. Really? Why?* Screen does not appear to auto-adjust and appears to be dark when viewed in a darkened room.* Screen is in a fixed position - this is not a device that is not lap friendly. It is designed to sit on a shelf or table.Conclusion:Amazon may very well be onto something with The Show. However, in this day and age, many other devices, stream music, play our movies etc it simply is not going to blow the doors off of your tablet....The greatest gift that this device offers is "voice control." If you have a physically disabled loved one who has a sound mind but an ailing body - this little device can open up the digital world to them.

B01J24C0TI	Can be used as a home security style camera.	One of the best purchases I've made. I own 2 Dots,Echo,dash wand, firestick with alexa and 2 Echo shows. I gave my family Dots for Christmas because they are so great. After owning nearly every echo device short of the look camera I can say that this is probably my favorite.I love  the Dots because of the cost, and form factor, I connected mine to a external speaker for the increased volume when playing music. You won't have that problem with the Show. The sounds is worlds better than the Dots and reasonably better quality and volume compared to the normal Echo.A problem that I had with the Echo was the microphones seemed to not pick up as well as the Dots. I figure this is the dot design is newer and so the microphone setup was likely revised. This very minor problem is also much better on the Echo show.What amazon did was take the best features of the Dots (the Microphones) the best features of the Echo(the speakers) and made them better and added a screen and camera.The camera works extremely well, the video calling works great from show to show or to the mobile app.********* I've found this trick***********************You can set up all your private echos dots, Echo, and shows to allow drop in. This acts as an intercom system...... WHAT I FOUND is if I'm at work and I want to drop in on either of my echo shows I can see whats going on at my house... just like a security wifi camera. I can drop in on the Dog, etc. Its a great peace of mind to know I can drop in on the shows video camera from my phone anytime, anywhere.The shows are worth their weight in gold if you ask me.I'm sure more show specific apps are on the way, and I hope many more visual skills come to the already robust voice assistant.What I'd like is the ability to ask Echo show for movies and have her send it to the fire stick on network.. (come on amazon, that shouldn't be that hard.)	J. Beshears	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/ABMDNB6HLOMST/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	9	5	2017/07/06

All kinds of cool apps likely to come.	ANDREW	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2BDHKS7U6KEDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	5	2017/07/06
B01J24C0TI	MUST HAVE!	We bought two of these and have one for upstairs and one for downstairs. If you have an echo or an echo dot and want to upgrade you will LOVE this echo show! I have one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom upstairs. I love listening to music with the lyrics. We have connected it to our front door using ring and our air conditioners. It is nice to turn the ac up or down when you are on the opposite side of the house or even in bed. I think the people that are disappointed with this product are unrealistic in what they expected. For the price, I think this thing is amazing. I mean it is the first of its kind. I am excited already for them to come out with updates and new releases. I even play some of the games it has, like deal or no deal when I am in the kitchen cooking. I also use it for my morning news update. It really is great. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE: Sometimes the alexa upstairs hears me when I am trying to talk to the alexa downstairs and then music will start playing upstairs and I have to go upstairs to turn that one off. Not that big of a deal though. I even took this with me to watch a movie while I was taking a relaxing bath... Alexa play me a funny movie! I use Alexa so much my son's first word was Alexa! I wish I was kidding! :)EDIT: I almost forgot to mention one of the greatest thing about this product.. ALEXA, add jelly to my grocery list. This feature is so nice.

B01J24C0TI	Nothing special to make it worth wild!	It's basically an Echo with a screen. I guess that's how it was advertised. I was just expecting more. I feel it should have been released with some rich new features. The home screen never shuts off, it's always on, no sleep mode. Alexa is no smarter either. Constantly saying she doesn't know that.I love being an early adopter of technology but, I should have waited on this one. Too expensive for nothing more than a screen.

B01J24C0TI	Disturbed by constant and changing screen messages	Very disappointed that the home screen is continually showing examples of what Alexa can do.

B01J24C0TI	Bad Design Choices	The Good - it's Alexa. That's why I bought 2 when the product dropped in June 2017.Speaking of June, we're months ahead of the Apple HomePod, and the Show has a touchscreen and MANY skills. Way ahead of Apple and MUCH cheaper. Price and availability shouldn't be forgotten - mine were under $200 each if you buy two units.Also The Good - the touchscreen is clear and there's a nice amount of interactivity. Youtube is great, buying on Amazon is waaaay better with Show than Dot, and fun to play with the allrecipes.com skill. Lets give Amazon a 5 so far...The Bad - they dropped the Aux output. And without Sonos integration (a promise that's 6 months going on what seems like forever) I'm really missing my Aux output. I've got a bluetooth patchwork that's lame. 2nd, why is the grill on the white model black?! Muy feo. This design point can't be fixed with a patch down the road. Neither can the speakers. The speakers are tinny (as in sound like tin). I miss the bass output of the original Echo. In fact, I have a Boston Acoustics clock radio with more thump. And final bad design, they dropped the button to physically activate Alexa. When I've got my music loud (thanks Sonos) or when the room is quiet, I just like to be able to press a button instead of using the wake word "Alexa". Amazon dropped the button altogether. Instead, there's a button to mute Alexa - I've never found a use case for muting Alexa.

B01J24C0TI	Alexa in Any Form	Okay so I'm no novice to Alexa products.  I own an Echo and a dot and a remote but I had to have the newest product so I bought the Show.Honestly, I'm not overly impressed.  The question then is would I be super impressed if I had never had an Echo or Dot and the answer is that I love Alexa.  The Show is minimally more useful than the Dot or Echo.  Yes, I can read lyrics but only about 70% of songs but the sound quality is most very good.  Yes, I can watch Amazon Prime but the screen is too small and I have a tablet and a laptop for that, The display shows tips for things to try (good) but then shows some crazy news story headline that piques my interest but then knows nothing about it when I ask (bad.)  You can look at your pictures but, then again, I can do that on any device so meh.  Now if she could wash my dishes.....maybe....I use Alexa for shopping lists (which you can see on the Show), appointment making, to-do lists weather updates, as an alarm, listening to music in the kitchen, some news (the news outlets usually have most of the same stories which can be annoying), playing Jeopardy to discover I'm so truly average, setting timers (multiple while I'm cooking), meditation, learning facts on Wikipedia, hearing lame jokes and for doing simple math.  She cannot search the web for you (except Wikipedia), sigh,  I still need Siri . I guess my bottom line comment is -  Buy Alexa in whatever form you can afford her.  I like my inexpensive Dot nearly as much as the, not so inexpensive Echo or Show.  She is great for a person who has 100 things going on and has a leaky memory.  Just sayin..I'm 54, not 24	Life Is Short	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AC0Y55X817BFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2017/07/06
B01J24C0TI	Amazon is way ahead of Apple	Great Amazon product. I have the Dot and now I have the Show. I have this on my nightstand by my bed. I like the alarm clock on it.

B01J24C0TI	Not much of an improvement on echo dot.	I bought this to replace a very old Sony Dash Sony HIDC10 Dash Personal Internet Viewer (Discontinued by Manufacturer) which I have LOVED for many years. The dash lived above the kitchen sink and kept me company while I cooked and cleaned. My dash died, and the Show looked like it had potential to be the perfect replacement. I used the Dash for 3 things 1. Watching Netflix 2. Watching Amazon Prime 3. Listening to Pandora. Of those 3 things, the only one I feel the show really replaces is Pandora. Amazon Prime streaming does a good job of that, and the voice controls for prime streaming are sufficient. As far as watching Netflix, it's not even an option, but I hope it will be eventually. Watching Amazon Prime is an option, but I find using the voice controls to find and start the show I want to watch unusable. I'm not sure why, I have an echo dot, and use it to control my thermostats/lights/pandora and to check weather and news daily without any issues. The Amazon Prime experience just isn't as intuitive. I'm considering returning and waiting to see if they improve on these flaws.	K.D.

B01J24C0TI	This thing is actually pretty decent and rather intuitive	This thing is actually pretty decent and rather intuitive. Alexa has the range for hearing your requests, and can do the simple stuff; play a movie, make a call, tell me the weather. The "task" loading is a bit arduous just because they're not particularly well defined, so if you want her to show you a News reel or something you have a bit of a challenge. For the most part, the device is very straight forward, decent speakers, okay video, picks up phonecalls good, does a heckuva job with music and audiobooks. It's just a matter of mastering what Alexa can do, and what she doesn't know yet.

B01J24C0TI	The Show steals the Show	Sorry It won't let me rotate my photosI think I expected more. I wanted "show" to do everything. I bought show to replace my echo in the kitchen. I thought she would be able to bring up you tube videos when I'm cooking (she can only do YouTube if it is featured). But I am in love. I am able to actually "see" my news when making the kids lunches. I get top headlines, and things todo. I used her over the weekend to stream music inside the house for a 4th of July party. But bst of all? My ability to "drop in" or video chat with my family. We have been using it as an intercom system. I also have called my kids from my Alexa app and video chatted while I was at the store. I currently want wn 1 echo, 3 dots, a tap and now a show. The show is now my favorite. My husband has always enjoyed trivia games on the echo. Now he is actually able to see and read the questions. I know in time she will be as smart as I want her to be, but until then.....we have to wait	Lex	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A3LKJRD2KSG1CD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	4	2017/07/06

B01J24C0TI	Just a music box-Alexa is NOT smart.	No instructions-no one fully explains the alexa app you must download and work from-I bought 2 one for my daughter in Missouri and 1 for me in Ohio-banking on the being able to talk to each other by video-the echo wont let you manually enter your contact numbers- everything must be done with alexa app-I don't have a smart phone.  When I didn't receive a manual-I figured everything must be done with echo-every question I asked alexa could not be answered-in any format-and no instructions on how to sync- I have an ipod-that was a no go as well.  I bought an online how to book for echo-that was also no help- just advertisement for the features of echo.  And if you want to see lyrics to music-thought I could do that with my Pandora songs-nope! You must pay $3.99 a month to get the Amazon music in order to see the lyrics.  If you purchase the online music the only thing the echo did do well was play music on command and tell me what movies were playing at the theater.	Christine D.

B01J24C0TI	Great purchase!	Connected Arlo Pro Security cameras to my Echo Show devices (bought 2).  I linked my built-in house speakers via bluetooth adapter on my old school non-wireless receiver and now play and listen to Amazon Music Unlimited songs of my choice wherever I happen to be in my home.  Connected tp-link mini-plugs to several lamps and a tv and use Alexa to turn on-off.  It took me several hours to get everything properly synched - mainly because I did not fully understand the Arlo and Alexa apps at first.Enabled a number of skills (news feeds, Tonight Show monologues, AllRecipes,weather, Jeopardy, word games, Jeopardy, Bible verses, etc.)  They work pretty well, but on occasion I can't understand Alexa's response.  I eliminated all the clocks in  my bedroom and now just Alexa for the time if I wake up in the middle of the night.  I use Alexa for alarms, timers, recipes,  and as a sound machine to fall asleep.My only complaint is that support is scant for this device and its accessories.  No troubleshooting information available from Arlo or Amazon for when you are having issues.  That is why the 4-star rating.	cewats	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AR883U6JV26OX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2017/07/05

Oh, and the lyrics and song info show up on the screen when playing music! Updated: still love it. Found out i could add pics to the background.

B01J24C0TI	Not ready for prime time	I own the first generation echo which used to control my thermostat lights on a lot of other things. Got the new echo show and cannot connect to my lights. And it up buying a new Phillips bridge for the lights. Still doesn't work. Spent 2 1/2 hour on the phone with every John, Michal and Tammy… From India.Finally ended up speaking to the third level technical support with tell me they would get back to me during the day or does the next day while they will try to fix it in the back.  That was three days ago.Will try to tinker with it a little more but would probably return it if they can fix it. Very disappointed with customer service. I guess my expectation from Amazon we're not realistic... I would wait before  buying it because I don't feel it is ready for prime time. And at the very least customer support for Amazon echo is definitely subpar.

B01J24C0TI	Perfect for Kitchen	We use this device daily. It's so handy and looks good in my kitchen. I use this to watch my shows via amazon video. This includes my HBO and Starz subscriptions. We also play music from amazon and SiriusXM. This does more than a kitchen TV ever could. It's great to have. I recommend it to anyone looking for a full service device that substitutes as a small kitchen tv.

B01J24C0TI	Clearly a first generation product but the best option currently out or likely to be released this year.	As someone who owns many of these smart assistants (3 full sized Echos, 3 dots, 1 Goggle Home and now 2 Echo Shows) and has extensive amount of use with them, I think I can speak to most of what you want to hear. :)This review will also address future models from Microsoft and Apple as well.I gave the Echo Show four stars even when it is clearly the best product released or announced right now. I did this because it is clear that this is a first generation device and needs to design tweaking to make it five stars. That being said, it is the best smart assistant out right now and will be for the rest of the year (if not longer).Right now if I was purchasing more units they would be Echo Shows. (This is out of the three Amazon products, the Google product and its possible future product with Wifi mesh built in and the Microsoft future product and the future Apple speaker.)I would not pay more than one fifty for anything without a screen unless you are going to be using it for music almost exclusively (and even then there are likely better options in pure wireless speakers.)Amazon Echo Show:+ Improved mic listening. Not sure if this was software but it clearly is able to hear me better during music playback at higher volumes. I have often wondered why Amazon doesn't just automatically cancel out the audio it is playing to what it is hearing as that simple fix would help a lot. I am not sure they have fully done that but they did something that makes the mic more responsive. (Since this could be software related, you might see this fix applied to the other Amazon devices in the future.)+ First device with a screen. While they are still developing apps to use it, already it adds a bunch of functionality.+ Video calls! This allows you to use them as video intercoms in your house too which is really handy.+ Able to take still photos+ Able to display your photos+ Able to show things (like the weather, items from Amazon and lyrics for songs)BUT WAIT, there's more! Yes, Amazon made the screen a TOUCH SCREEN which means it is super useful for those times when selecting something is faster than trying to explain via voice what you want to do. This means it can replace a tablet for some light tasks. One of the single favorite things for me--wifi setup. It was SO much faster just to be able to type my wifi password directly instead of having to use a cell phone and the Alexia app and hoping it will work.+ Directly scroll through Amazon listings with photos, pricing and details and purchase items without having to have Echo "guess" what you mean.+ Having both a screen and touch sensitiveness means so many future apps/skills will be made possible.Plus compared to other brands products, nothing is as easy to use or more full featured than the Echo family. We recently purchased the Google Home to keep in the living room to compare it to the Amazon Show we have in there and commonly my wife and I ask the same question of both devices. I was (and continue to be) shocked at how much Google Home's device can't answer or how wordy it can be when actually doing something. For example, this means playing music takes longer to start.More surprising to me is the lack of progress Google seems to be making on the Home. Amazon's Echos fix/improve nearly every week and you can do things today that you couldn't do last month, yet Google seems to be really slow at adding/improving functionality. And I am not even talking about apps/skills. The fact that Amazon's Echos can do things with Googles products like Calendar that Goggle's Home can't do is embarrassing.Head to head, 60% of the time Echo is able to provide an answer or better answer to Google's Home's 40%. Now no one can see into the future but it already feels like Google is losing interest in really improving their products.Negatives:- Screen should tilt for improving viewing angles- Camera should tlt for better placement options. This would help so you don't have to adjust where you are sitting/standing. For example right now when I video call my wife I see the ceiling fan unless she stands up.- Font size should be adjustable in case you have it across the room (could be fixed via software update)- Audio is very directional, unlike the Amazon Echo (without the screen). I am also not sure that it actually sounds better than the Echo but I will do more side by side testing.-Design is pretty dull. Looks like a Sony Dash (a product from 2009 which means it is 8 years old in design) except not as good! Also reminds me of the old huge rear projector TVs that Sony and other brands made many, many years ago.- Seems like it could/should have a battery built in.- Mesh wifi hubs built in (like Google is rumoured to be working on) would have been awesome.Quick points about competing products:Amazon's Echo: Great device but unless it drops to about half the current price, the show is a better value for all the extra features you get,Amazon's Dot: By far the cheapest way to get started. It does so much for the small price tag but do not plan on listening to music on it without using other speakers. These are nice for less used rooms/spaces.Apple's upcoming HomePod: While Apple makes great products, this device is not really in the same league as the Echo Show. Apple's Homepod will likely sound better than anything else for playing music but will lack most of the features and functions of the Echo line. Get this only if you want a smart speaker for music and the cost doesn't bother you.Google's Home: Fine but my guess is that Amazon will drop their Echo's price (not the new Echo Show) to about the same and it is clearly a better product with better sound, more features and more functions. I have one Google Home and have no interest in purchasing more until they improve it.Google's rumored future device with Wifi Mesh built in: I like the idea but I have been disappointed in the Google home as it stands and Google's mesh Wifi routers are known for being pretty slow so unless they fix that, it seems like a clunker--esp if it doesn't have a screen.Microsoft's future smart speaker: Typically when Amazon and Google are options compared to Microsoft's hardware, it always is the weakest. From my point of view they are making a device not because they love the idea, but so they aren't left in the dust. It will be fine but my guess is that it will be buggy at times and be very limited on functions. I would certainly no preorder it.

It seems like 30-40% of the scrolling feed that crosses the screen in my new Alexa Show is sports related. It is bad enough that you fill up my feed with the names of every sports person who signs a new contract, but you even blast me with international sports news. Make it stop!!! I tweeted about this and was told you do not offer me an opprtunity to see what I want, instead of what you think I want to see.

B01J24C0TI	Not there yet	Honestly, like many others said, I was expecting more.  This is not more  useful than the Echo and while yes, you can view movies on the mini screen, there is no menu and trying to locate the one isn't a given even if you ask for prime movies, you will only get a handful showing.  I bought it because I had truly hoped that FINALLY there would be a device out there that would allow use of the Alexa features for hearing impaired.  Nope this one is not it either and too bad because it could have been great to be able to talk or video call someone and have live captions/subtitles.So all in all, not seeing a true value in it all.  Takes space and realize I likely wont use it much at all.  Too bad...maybe a better version one day which takes into consideration consumers' comments will be better.  This one is just not there yet.	a customer	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/ANVA2ED6B81AY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	3	2017/07/05
B01J24C0TI	Echo Show - Black	i wrote a review within hours of opening the box. I was sent an email to review the product but when I sent it, it bounced back saying the product was not out yet. So here was my review:  Echo Show arrived late afternoon. Played with it all evening and spent the evening having the device read one of the books in my library. I could not figure out how to get news from Los Angeles. The only news it would deliver was NPR from Washington D.C. Was really looking for an update on local fires. I am sure I will figure it out.  Like the changing background and the notification sound when I speak. Setup was very simple. I am going to setup the second unit in the kitchen. The kitchen has an area with a desk and work area, so this will be a perfect spot for recipes while in the kitchen and music or homework help while at the desk. This is a definite 5 star out of the box.  It has been a week now, and I love this thing even more. It reads my Audible books, gives me the news, keeps my market list, sets my alarms and so much more. Don't know how I lived without it.

B01J24C0TI	The first thing that amazed me is that I couldn't control the messages that ...	I've only had by Echo Show for a week.  I have several Echos and Dots, and I thought I'd replace my NixPlay picture frame and Echo with a single device that does it all.  Someday this will be possible, I'm sure, but I'm not sure it's within reach with the Echo Show.The first thing that amazed me is that I couldn't control the messages that show up on the screen except for my calendar, etc.  I really don't care whether "Church Goers Get Wooed with a Loyalty Program" or "Firemen rescue baby deer."  The sound quality is fairly good, as is the (small) screen.  But it's not clear when any of that is an upgrade from the regular Echo.In addition, it appears that users cannot have the screen turn off completely and turn back on in proximity, something my Nest thermostat as well as my NixPlay do.Ultimately, I'm sure all this will be worked out--but when ultimately will arrive, and whether it will depend on hardware improvements, is unclear.  Many of the critical/negative comments on this thread seem true to me.  I'm not sure it's worth keeping.	Lawrence M.

B01J24C0TI	Keep your money	I was excited to see an echo with a screen going up for sale so like many others I eagerly ordered not only one but two for the discounted price.I did receive the shows on release day and that’s the end of the good news. The show is so limited at least right now with what the screen is useful for. I assumed (shouldn’t have)with the screen I would be able to stream other video services which isn’t the case only amazon video and u tube.i thought this was gonna be like a upgraded phony dash which I loved and phony cut ties with to quickly.  I really hoped the alarm problem with the original echo would also be fixed and I could play music with alarms and that’s still the same being annoying sounds or a small cast of famous people talking you awake.if I didn’t purchase one as a gift I would return but I’m stuck with it so hopefully so updates come out VERY SOON.

B01J24C0TI	Adds some capabilities to the Echo, but can be underwhelming.	I think there's alot of high expectations for Echo products. The first Echo was obscure and new, and most people weren't sure what to do with besides play music and ask questions, but then it evolved into a system that can be extremely helpful when utilized the right way. Nowadays, I'm used to controlling lights and tv's with Alexa which was a game-changer for me. For Echo Show, it's a nice benefit to have a screen so that you can voice-control functions that require more than a audible response (watch a show, watch youtube, video-call a family member). Although the product itself looks pretty bad, the screen looks nice and doesn't ruin the aesthetic surrounding the object- it looks like a chunky digital photo frame.The software needs to get better- Alexa can lead to a few dead ends when you are trying to get her to show youtube videos or a specific recipe, and it's not intuitive how you get in and out of skills from the screen.It's a learning curve, and I imagine most customers who purchased the Echo Show are existing Echo customers who expect that this device will change their life as much as the Echo did, but are underwhelmed by the capabilities of Echo Show since it doesn't really add as much functionality as you would expect with a screen.

B01J24C0TI	NIce but disappointing	I am a little disappointed with the Show - it is underwhelming. I have 3 full-size Echos and 3 Dots, so I am familiar with the Echos. I was expecting more with this, perhaps additional video features will be developed in the future.Originally, I was going to have this on my nightstand and act as an alarm; however, there is no option to verbally turn off the screen and have it remain off. I can ask it to "turn off the screen" (which it sometimes gets confused by and wants to know which device, but does not like its own name, and other times complies without issue - I am from the Midwest and speak very clearly). The screen will also turn back on without my asking it to. Since the screen will not remain off, the Show found itself residing in my home office and displacing the Dot. Given the space in the office and the sound level difference between the Show and Dot, the having the Show in my office is overkill.Also, I have Nest cameras around my house and I love the idea of having whichever camera brought up on demand. However, the camera will not stay on and eventually the Show returns to the home display. A bit frustrating when I may be watching the front of the house for a visitor or delivery but it stops monitoring.Finally, I did buy two and was trying to decide what to do with both - one on the nightstand and the other in my office, one on the nightstand and the other in the kitchen, or keep one for wherever and give the other as a gift to someone in the family (my kids could then video chat with their cousins, uncles & aunts, or grandparents that live a considerable distance away. Given the previously mentioned issues, I will not be running into an issue of wanting to buy more to have these placed wherever. The lackluster use limits my options - I think the second will end up being a gift to someone that lacks an Apple product to do Face Time.

I guess it will come with time.- It does not recognize different user voices, everyone can ask my Alexa something, and she does respond when she should notSummary:A great buy.

B01J24C0TI	Alexa, get me a beer.	This is a great product.  The build quality is top notch, and speech recognition is excellent even in a large, moderately noisy room.  Many of the skills that exist for the Echos don't yet take full advantage of the display, but I suspect this will change quickly as adding a display to Alexa's capabilities is a game changer for these connected home devices.I'm a techie guy and was able to write a home automation skill in one weekend for my custom home automation system.  If you develop software for a hobby or a living, you'll find skill development pretty straightforward and well-documented.I think we're finally seeing signs that home automation with good integration and user interfaces is within reach.  This device is the perfect interface, and one that my non-techie wife and daughter embraced quickly.  They've figured out how to do many things with Alexa before I did, which is a first for any form of technology... ever!  (Of course the first thing I wanted to do was figure out how to write a skill!)  My daughter refers to the device as "our robot" which makes me realize that yes, maybe an actual Echo Robot is what should be next.  "Alexa, get me a beer."I bought two of these with the $100 off deal, and just logged back in to buy two more, but discovered you can only buy two with that deal.  Bummer.Finally, I was initially concerned about having a house full of these plugged in sucking electricity all day.  Lighting up a fairly big display isn't cheap, but somehow the devices manage to only consume 3-4 Watts when sitting idle (measured on the AC side of the power supply and with the display fully lit).  That's quite remarkable.  "Intel Inside" seems to have brought some pretty good power management.

B01J24C0TI	An Alexa device with a screen that is underutilized.	This is basically an Amazon Echo with a screen.  Amazon Echo has been out a few years and what it can do is well defined (smart home, news, traffic, etc), so this review will be about what's different about the Echo and the Echo Show and that is the screen.Surprisingly the screen is fairly underutilized. Yes it will display the time and weather information as well as interest headlines that Amazon picks, but other than that the screen isn't really used that much.  That said you can use the screen to play videos (YouTube and Amazon Video) as well as Photos (Amazon Photos), so the screen isn't completely ignored, but a lot of the time the screen is simply used to display words that Alexa is speaking.  There are some skills that use the screen, but most do not.The are "pages" which can be set up in the options for things that as far as I can tell never actually display, namely Notifications and Drop Ins.  The Calendar page will show up, but only if there is an event in the next day.  The tips that the Echo Show constantly displays cannot be turned off, which is also annoying.Speaking of the screen, there is no real way to turn it off.  You can ask Alexa to "turn off the screen", but without changing the settings to hide the clock, that simply displays a clock with the backlight still turned on. That is surprisingly bright in a dark room even with the brightness turned all the way down.  Also the screen will turn back on any time the Show hears (or thinks it hears) the word "Alexa".  The screen will also turn itself "off" on its own if it doesn't detect movement or sound, but any movement or using the word "Alexa" will turn the screen back on again.  There is no option to adjust the screen timeout or have it simply not turn on at all, which would be useful for nighttime use.  Keep that in mind if you plan to put this in your bedroom.EDIT: After a recent software update, the screen will turn completely off when asked.  Also putting the Show in Do Not Disturb mode will switch the screen to the ambient clock and disable waking up when it detects motion.There's also a somewhat annoying bug that causes the message notification to get stuck in its current state (either never displaying or always displaying) until the Show is rebooted.  This happens if the home screen setting which tells the Show to display a photo background or simply black or white is changed.  Edit: This may or may not have been fixed as I haven't tested this after the recent software update.Overall the Echo Show is primarily an Echo so it has the Alexa interface, which in itself is an excellent product.  As such the Show is as good as an Echo from a usage standpoint.  Right now there's not enough usage of the screen to warrant paying extra for the Show, but I'm hoping that will change in the future.

B01J24C0TI	The best Echo, but is it worth the $50 premium?	The short answer is: yes, this is worth the premium of the regular Echo. Here's why in detail:1) The bright touch screen makes the human-machine communication easier than with an audio-only black box (correction: black cylinder). A quick glance at the Echo Show yields a picture of the artist, lyrics, album art, the weather, or wikipedia info. That picture is worth more than a thousand words. That is obviously exaggerated: the true extra value of the screen is probably a dozen words spoken by Alexa's synthetic voice. Still, that is better.2) The main advantage of the screen is to enhance the existing Echo experience. The new capabilities of the touch screen are also pretty cool. Saying "Alexa play youtube Stephen Colbert" is faster than grabbing a smartphone out of the pocket, followed by some frantic fingering. Echo show is great for short interactions such as news events. It's also possible to watch Amazon prime video, but such longer engagements on a small screen are not the sweet spot. This is Echo Show, not Echo TV.3) It is my impression that the sound quality is a bit better than the conventional Echo. The new Echo Show has 2 front facing speakers that project true stereo sound. The original Echo is mono.4) The Echo Show screen adds colorful eye candy to the kitchen counter. Music is shows wit album art. A nice touch is that the screen dims dark when nobody is in sight. It immediately wakes up as soon as some movement is in its field of view.5) The video call capability is great for setting up a connection with elderly parents. Echo Show is easier to operate than a smartphone and the camera is always in the right upright position. I was pleasantly surprised that it is possible to call the Echo dot in my daughter's room, even though it is on the same account. The system is very easy to setup and convenient to use.After all these positive points, I have to mention one weaker issue of the Echo Show. The original Echo is an industrial design masterpiece: an iconic cylinder made from excellent materials. It will end up in art musea next to iconic Apple and Braun designs. The teardown at iFixit shows that this beauty runs more than skin-deep, with elegant engineering of the inner components. The Echo Show is not at that level. It is not even close with its utilitarian square design and cheaper looking plastic. It looks like any $30 clock radio at first glance. That is a missed opportunity, because the Show will have to be placed in a prominent place in kitchens or the living room.Overall, the Echo Show is a good functional improvement over the orginal Echo. It is a product that is ahead of any competition, while still at a reasonable price point. Kudos for Amazon in pulling this off so well. Echo is a device that Apple should have brought to market, but wasn't able to without Steve Jobs. Jeff Bezos turns out to be a worthy successor of Steve's spirit.

B01J24C0TI	Better than expected	I have 2 Echo Shows (so far) and they are turning out to be much better than I was expecting. Some of my favorite features are:-Using Drop In for room to room video intercom calls is excellent and I plan to expand my system to more rooms for this feature alone.-The family loves having lyrics displayed when they play music-The viewing angle works well for desk and countertop viewing and the units are solid enough to stay put when you are pressing the touchscreen. A stationary device is a huge improvement over struggling to hold and use a tablet in the kitchen or at your desk.-The touchscreen and voice complement each other better than I expected. Voice commands put you directly on the screen you want without tapping through layers of menus and the touchscreen makes it easy to select something that would be awkward to articulate as a verbal command.-Viewing security cameras is an awesome feature and is another reason I will be buying more of these.-I was also surprised how handy it is to have Alexa show me a numbered list of YouTube videos or my music playlists and then select one by telling her to "play number x"Looking forward to getting some more of these!

B01J24C0TI	Love The Echo Show...	So far, so good. Setting this up was so simply and trouble free it was a no brainer. Has all the features the my Echo Dot had and more. I love the fact that this unit hears my voice much better than the Dot did and I have it sitting on my bedroom dresser. I set it up using the "do not disturb" feature at night and I am still able to use the alarm and I turn it off in the morning. I have this plugged into my battery backup so if we loose power, it will still be up and running. Since I just set this up last night, I haven't tried accessing YouTube etc but because it was setup from Amazon using my account info, I didn't have to enter any info other than the WIFI password. That saved me so much time and all my WIFI smart lights and smart plug work perfectly. My daughter has the other unit but hasn't set it up as yet and I purchased another one for her out of state friend so they can chat using the Show instead of facetime on the iPhone. Haven't tried the person to person calling feature yet but I'm sure that will work fine also. Over all, I'm very happy with this product. Thank you Amazon.

B01J24C0TI	Everything i loved about original Echo & so much more!	I was lucky enough to get an Echo invitation when it was first introduced.  We ordered 2 more since then.  We love them.  So when I saw the email about the Echo Show, I ordered 2 that day.  It has everything I love about the original, but the screen makes it so much more.  Being able to see things like my calendar, Alexa deals and answers to my questions is so helpful since it gives me time to peruse at my own pace.  The sound quality is amazing and the picture on screen is clear and crisp.  I am very impressed and happy with my Echo Show.I did not receive any discounts for my review.

One of the best selling points is the lyrics of songs while the music is playing...basically making this a Karaoke machine.  The speaker is an upgrade and I also think that the microphone is more sensitive.  So far, so good!

B01J24C0TI	It's great, except for the homescreen.	Echo Show is a nice little device.I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the incredibly intrusive and annoying homescreen. Yes, it's so bad that it's worth removing 2 stars over it.What's wrong with the homescreen? Well, you literally cannot turn off the newsfeed that scrolls across the bottom. Yes, you can go into settings and turn off certain types of news, but you can never get rid of the "Tips" from Amazon.The Echo Show currently has a prominent place in my living room. However, I will not allow Amazon to advertise its services to my houeguests. If the homescreen doesn't offer an option without newsfeed in the next 2 weeks, then I'll need to return the 2 Shows that I bought.

B01J24C0TI	Meh.	As a regular echo it works fine.  I only have one so I have no idea how video/intercom work.  There doesn't seem to be much to do with the screen.  This is probably perfect for the kitchen.  What ruins it, though, is that there is no way to turn off the annoying suggestions that appear endlessly.  Seriously?  It is like a running ad (Try "Alexa, find albums by Billy Joel").  Does Billy get a cut from this crap?  I bought it mainly to keep up with technology and this does nothing for me.  I am sure there will be improvements in time.	David Mackenzie	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A20R85HOGY4YGB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	2	2017/07/05

B01J24C0TI	Lots of potential, but fix the setup	I'll do a pros and cons:Cons first: when compared to the pairing system of the echo and echo dot, this thing doesn't work anywhere near as well for pairing. You can't pair with your mobile, which makes it somewhat painful if you have a wifi pw that happens to be a 26 character hexadecimal. Add in that the firmware update failed 3 times, due to a "slow connection". Probably Amazon's firmware servers were slow, as I tested my bandwidth at 50mbps down sustained. As far as use: screen is a bit small for something you have setting down.That's it for the cons. Like I said, setup was painful.Pros: The sound quality is astonishing (it had better be for the price). The screen quality and touch response is quite good. The tip displays are great and very useful. The skills are expanding more, so that's rather nice. Of course, one of the major reasons I got it was for Ring integration. It works well, though I'm disappointed that sometimes I have to issue the command twice... Once to wake the camera, then again to show it. Why can't it just issue the wake command to the doorbell, then wait? Probably Ring's fault on that... Wait, this is the pros section.I've found this to be an ideal nightstand device.

B01J24C0TI	Mixed opinions	I like the new show, but wish it had a larger screen or a port to attach to a tv screen. I also think the flash briefing should come with more video footageRather than some of them just saying the new channel name. I think they should also contract with sling, Netflix or Hulu so you can also watch additional shows other than just what is on prime. Other wise we are happy with ours. I do think the price is a little high for what it is.	Eunice Green	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AXWZFVRIFCNBN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/07/04

B01J24C0TI	Lacking Features, Bad Speaker, bad waste of money. Too early to buy	Very underwhelming. The speakers are really bad and the screen is too small for videos.The main reason i bought this even though i have 3 other echos is for the video calling and to view my arlo camera system but the camera for video calling sucks and doesnt support any other video services other than amazon show. So you can only call people with the app on their smartphone or amazon show device, no desktop support, completely useless. Also the ringing is obnoxiously loud and you cant change the ring tone.Also the arlo skill is extremely slow to boot up so if you want to see who is outside using the echo show and an arlo pro camera it takes almost 10-15 seconds to even load, completely useless.No bluetooth or usb. Its also really large in the back, reminds me of a picture-tube tv from the 1990's. Hopefully their second generation wont be a complete fail like this was.You cant even customize the home screen or even completely turn off the device. Fix this amazon!Currently i wouldnt recommend it. I regret buying 2. Wait until amazon fixes this crappy device	Sree P	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AXNOKV2TON23G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	1	2017/07/04
B01J24C0TI	Really wanted to love this new one.	Well, let me start off by saying I thought this would be a really extraordinary addition to the Echo offerings, but its at best, so so. The $230 price tag is at least $100 over what it should be for such a small screen, with no input or output capabilities at all. I'd say the best part of the Show, is the good sound quality, and since I don't have an Echo, can't say how much better this is than that. $230 will buy you a fairly good laptop these days! So far, other than using it for a few silly games, as a half good digital picture frame that can play music simultaneously,not much going on here. I can see where when they come out with gen 4 or 5 we may get wowed,but not yet.  I feel Amazon rushed this out to the market, to avoid being 'scooped' by another company...little thought went into its design or function at the point of this release. If they wanted the first buyers of this device to be beta testers, then they should have sent them along withoutcharge. Who came up with the shape of this thing...shame on them, its ridiculous. My first attempted echo show to echo call proved to me that putting 8 mics into this device was a waste, the caller couldn't hear me clearly unless the device was less than 2 feet away from my face! And not being able to move the camera angle? Why they would allow photos to be placed on the home screen and then not allow the annoying 'hints/suggestions' that block those photos to not be deleted is beyond me. This device has a lot of work that needs yet to be done, and unfortunately much of it should have been done while it was still on the drawing board, not in consumers hands. I expect thousands of these will be getting returned as people wait for them to offer a 'finished' Echo Show at a later date.UPDATE: 7-15-17: I stand by all of my above observations. I just wanted to add that I indeed did decide to return this and on Prime Day was able to purchase an Echo and Echo Dot, for just over half of what I paid for this screened Echo. I find that I do feel the sound of the Echo is a bit superior to the Show, and the little Dot, hooked up to our Bose clock radio, sounds better than either of them! With the money I saved, I can start looking for a real digital frame, which is the main reason I took a chance on the Show to begin with. I've no doubt that Amazon will continue working on the Show and it will turn out to be a great device, but I'm too old to wait.

B01J24C0TI	Do not buy more than 1 until they fix issues- It is clearly a work in progress. Needs to improve.	I own 4 regular amazon echo's. I love it. I bought 4 echo shows also. That's right.....4.  I bought them with the thought of using them as an intercom system in the house.  The bedroom echo show can call the basement or living room or garage echo show.  But this has not worked out. So these are the issues with it and I will not change my 3 star review until these are resolved:1) I should be able to name the echo shows and say "call the living room" or "call the basement" and use it as an intercom system2) The screen should shut off and stay completely off when I tell it to. 4 plugged in echo shows in my house and I go from echo show to echo show telling it to shut off its damn screen and what does it do? Shuts off only to turn back on all by itself without any commands.  Also, when I say off it should mean off. Not to display the time with some background semi-lit black screen. Off means off and stay off until I tell it otherwise.3) I should be able to tell it shut off screen from any application. If it is playing youtube I have to annoyingly tell it to go to the home screen before I can tell it to shut off.4) if I tell it "Alexa search for youtube video michael jackson smooth criminal" it should do what I ordered it to. Not give me samples of Michael Jackson off amazon music. I did not ask for amazon music. I asked for youtube.  And this is clearly done over and over again with any type of music you ask it to look up on youtube. It attempts to default to amazon music despite the command to the contrary. Ridiculous.I could keep going with issues but I won't.  I really wanted this to be 5 stars and it easily can be.  They just need to fix issues. Then I can change my review.

Video calling was one of the main reasons I bought this product and I thought they are planning to release some kind of skype like skill but you can video call someone only if that person has echo show. Unless everyone you know has echo show this feature is completely useless.4-I pay for almost all of amazon services including Amazon Music Unlimited for echo. I was surprised to find out that this services is not supported on this devices and I have to upgrade my plan if I want to listen the same music that I listen on my other echos!5-No Bluetooth!!!

B01J24C0TI	I like it but would like a USB connection for memory sticks and the ability to stream movies from my PERSONAL library.	Of Course I like it. However, I can't believe they didn't put in a USB connection at least so I could plug in a memory stick with music, video or photos on it. It won't play videos streamed from the Amazon drive storage. It WILL play your Amazon movies from your video library but it is touchy about the subject. Just try asking it to play  the movie Megamind and you will get all sorts of wrong, You will have to ask for it to display Will Ferral movies and then search through the list to find it. Same goes for trying to play a song from your library OR from amazon music by the K-pop group 2NE1. It cannot cope with that at all. I accept that 2NE1 poses a problem in the English language (to Anyone) It has other issues such as Music by Headeast. Again it must have to do with phonics. If I make a separate play list for Headeast I can call out the play list to get it to work but defeats the purpose of asking for a song BY Headeast. Yet I can mumble words and it goes right through. I have ALL Echo devices and Alexa on Amazon TV and they all seem to work with me fine. I have TWO Echo Show devices and they both seem to have issues with my words when compared to the other devices. But still I like it a lot for quick things I need an answer to. I am definitely going to save up for some smart home devices.

B01J24C0TI	I like it a lot . . .	Very pleased with this new version of Echo thus far.  Set-up was a breeze, and it automatically transferred my Pandora stations, etc.  I'm still exploring all it can do, but I use it mostly for music and I like the on-screen pictures of artists, etc., plus lyrics on many of the songs that come through Amazon's music service.  I find the sound to be a little more treble and less bass than I would like, but it's a minor concern.  I've watched a few YouTube videos on it, checked out weather and also sports scores, set some timers and reminders, etc.  An amazing gadget that I will continue to learn about in the weeks ahead, but I'm very glad to have it already.	kleervu	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1PWE3XKMIWK9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	5	2017/07/04

This is not equivalent to a "Drop In".  I want it to be discreet...2) Direct access to apple music with an app (or "skill") rather than through me uploading the same music to Amazon cloud, or through bluetooth and iphone3) Using the device as electronic picture frame with direct access to Photos in Mac OSx.  And no I dont want to copy all my photos into Amazon cloud!I can go on and on.I understand that Amazon and Apple compete in some of these areas, but I am not going to change my entire infrastructure to an Amazon based infra (it is not even possible as there are no equivalents to a Mac Book from Amazon!) just to be able to use Echo Show.Unfortunately I am returning my devices...	viper2004	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A3V0E8HDU7ZP6Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	2	2017/07/04

With the addition of video, One nice feature that could have been added as including a real time character that can speak to users like choose your favorite star as a face and that face could be pictured to the agent to speak to you, so you can feel it as a real time conversation. Also, another feature that could have been added is, based on the history of all the search a user has done, can alexa start a conversation with the user when needed, something like I was searching for a product and I would like to know when it becomes available, instead of an email, Alexa starting a conversation would be better too..

I would like it to display the time and weather (weather in detail) continuously, it doesn't (no option for it). I would not recommend this at all.

B01J24C0TI	The Coolest device available but some disappointments	I was hoping for more. Amazon Show is apearantly no smarter than its predecessor. The touch screen performs well. Movies are watchable on the Show but why would I do that. The speakers are improved and it sounded well for that size but where is the audio out connection! Bad design decision to skip an audio out either analog or digital. I'd like the show to be well integrated into my home theater but not without connecting it to my surround receiver. Also, where is the ability to see web content? Not even weather radar! Another design blunder. Missing are more comprehensive on board settings feature. Lacking is screen brightness and time out to screen saver adjustment. Also no audio (bass/treble) settings. Are there audio commands for that? I wouldn't know because there is currently very scarce user instructions available. The software is glitchly at times but no lock-ups. This produce gives all the appearance of being rushed out. Yipes! I still give it four stars because it's cool, it's the best AI voice command thing on the market for now and it controls some of my smart devices. I hope the Show gets smarter, displays web content and adds more smart connectivity partners.	Scott G.

B01J24C0TI	Not happy	I'm terribly disappointed with the show. It keeps scrolling through headlines, calendar events, etc, plus keeps suggesting things to ask Alexa to do. Just give me a static home screen, I'll ask Alexa what I can do if I want to. Also find it unacceptable to include calendar info - so much for privacy when guests are looking at it. And headlines are close to childish - who cares if Justin Bieber's shoe is for sale!!! I bought two of these with second to be given to relative as house warming gift but haven't done so yet since so disappointed with ours. Have called and emailed Amazon customer service to see how to stop headlines and Alexa suggestions but told  can't stop and will eventually stop as Alexa learns ... what amount of time is that? Will probably return this week.	Letsmotor	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2OLO8BXNP6A5R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	3	2017/07/04
B01J24C0TI	Good product- but screen isn't adding that much yet	I was very excited for this product. As an early echo buyer, I pre-ordered this almost the day it came up, assuming that it might sell out. All in all, I was generally disappointed. It seems like a "rushed" product that strove to beat the googles, apples, etc of the world out of the gate with the 1st home assistant with a screen.I will caveat my review (6 days after release) by stating that Amazon still has plenty of time to make updates/changes to the show and hopefully will over the next few months. So, given that,  here are my pros and cons:PROSVideo calls- It can make video calls with phones with the alexa app and other echo shows. I'll admit I haven't used this yet, but I'll also say that I wasn't really looking for a home phone with this purchase. If this feature is important to you, you will probably be happy with the purchase as it is significant. Just bear in mind, that the people you call need the app or the show..Screensaver- It gives you different information as well as ways to use it on the screensaver. One of the challenges of the initial echo device was disseminating information on new features. The screen allows for that and will give you ideas on how to use it, which I think is great, especially with updates.All previous echo functions- They work and are supported by a screen, typically displaying text (big win for the hearing impaired).CONSOverall Poor Video integration- While you can watch just about any prime movie or show (why?) it is fairly challenging to access more summary/news or "snackable" video content. This unfortunately puts the echo on a level similar to my cars infotainment system, which is disappointing.  My initial disappointment came when asking for sports highlights. Alexa delivers scores without much other information and basically displays the box score or what is reading on the screen. Overall, I'd chalk this shortfall to poor or non-existent publisher integrations. This was a great opportunity for amazon to strike deals with major media companies for inclusion on echo (in a similar way to how snapchat has done, they could almost carbon copy their snapchat content). In addition, youtube is integrated into the show, but is very hard to navigate. That said, it will play a reuters news briefing if you ask for the news, which about all I found positive in video.Inconsistent use of touch screen- Sometimes you can, sometimes you can't. Its frustrating and I've honestly gotten stuck on certain screens.Wifi issues- I've heard this in other reviews, so I'm glad i'm not crazy. It seems to have trouble in some cases with wifi connectivity and suddenly you'll make a request to alexa and it'll be in some odd holding pattern. I bought 2 of these (one for my dad) and experienced it at his house, but not at my own, so not sure exactly what is driving the issue.HOLDING OUT HOPE FOR UPDATES IN COMING MONTHS!

B01J24C0TI	Happy Customer	I have had an echo dot for about a year now and love it. This is basically that with a screen so I assumed it would be even more awesome.... So far.. I was right! I've only had it since launch but my first impression is well... I'm very impressed. I bought two of these, one for me and one for my mom, so she could easily do video calls with the kids. I actually think the drop-in feature is pretty cool. There is so much more I wish I could do with this, like use it as a surveillance device (which may be possible? Likely if it isn't it will be in the future) I have lots of smart devices and being able to control them via Alexa is in general pretty cool.One complaint I do have is when using this with my Arlo cameras, it is a bit slow to show them and sometimes they don't come up and I have to ask again. (This could also be an Arlo issue not Alexa, not sure)Bottom line, this is a really cool device. I am sure you could nit-pick the crap out of some things, but really there isn't any other device that does what this does all-in-one so it does what it does better than anything else available.(oh... I wish I could have Alexa ignore my 4 year old. LOL)	DigitalAlien	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2317UGE3HK4Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	4	2017/07/04
B01J24C0TI	Need a CURRENT smartphone	Beware of compatibility!!  Amazon does not announce this because they say in their product specs that this thing is "compatible with IOS and Android versions of the Alexa app".  Not exactly truthful.  I bought two echo shows for the single reason to communicate with my mother over video.  However, she has an older Android phone, which is not compatible with the latest version of the Android OS. (operating system for the phone itself)  When I called Amazon support, they informed me that unless I upgrade the Android phone, I can't get the latest Alexa app to install on her phone to use the video feature of Echo show.  REALLY????  I have to upgrade to a newer phone (that allows the latest version of the Android OS to be able to use Echo show???Don't get me wrong, the Echo show IS cool, but I am not able to even use it now for the reason I purchased it for both of us.  BEWARE before you purchase that if you have a phone without the latest Andriod OS installed, the newest Alexa app version cannot be installed to the phone either, eliminating one of the main new features that echo show was built for. (or advertised for)  I want to say that the developers of Echo Show were lazy not to make the Alexa app backward compatible with older OS versions.  What a shame.  With AI (Artificial Intelligence) being the latest and greatest thing since sliced bread - and what Echoes claim to be best at, it is not 'intelligent' enough to work with older versions of an Android OS. Really bummed that this wasn't advertised by Amazon before I purchased it.

B01J24C0TI	So far, we like this! [updated]	I got 3 of these when they first came out (there was a promo discount when you bought 2.) My family lives in different parts of the state and we thought it would be nice to interact with them through this AND have the other echo skills (like music, weather, etc.) I have all the echo devices so far except the "echo look" (regular echo, tap, and dot.) Each has its own benefits such as size, sound, portability, etc. The screen is awesome though.I am not sure however if each echo in a different house will need their own amazon account. It is all my immediate family (husband works out of town most weekdays, kids in college, and home.) If they use their own account, they won't have access to the prime stuff since we all share my prime account. But if they all are registered to MY account, how do I call the other one? So far we have only set up one and are unsure what to do with the other two. I may call support to see how this is done and will update my review when I find out. We would also like to use it to check in on our house and cats when we are away, but we don't know how to "answer" it if we aren't there. Maybe we can call our phone answering machine and accept the show call with that voice! ha ha!! That seems like a weird workaround. I don't know if there is an automatic setting to answer a call from another show. That seems nice for checking in on an empty house or for someone ill or something. Of course, you would have to pre-approve calls from certain others, but it seems it should be capable of doing that. Since you can connect to other cameras (they show a baby's room in their video) then you should be able to connect to other Echo Shows without a voice acceptance. There is the IFFT app or "mybuddy" where someone who wants to alert others with just a voice, but that isn't video yet to my knowledge.It works just like an echo using your voice, but also has a touchscreen. I didn't really review here all of the alexa features as that has been covered (a lot!) on the regular echo pages, My review is more about the differences. It scrolls news items and tips on the home screen, but you can turn that off if you ask for "display off" where it only displays a white on black digital clock. Well, sometimes it works...other times it asks "which device" and doesn't understand. I am sure this will be tweaked as the devices rolls out. It is pretty new. The size of the screen is listed as 7" diagonally, but those those like me, (who can't clearly visualize that hypotenuse measurement!) the screen itself is about 6 inches wide by 3.5 inches tall.We have indeed checked weather, asked questions, ordered products, and watched youtube videos on it. We aren't good at searching through youtube yet, but it does give you some suggestions based on your command. I am not sure how much we will use the feature for movies or something since it is so small, it would be nice to ask THIS to control your amazon fire stick or something on your tv or to cast your show. But so far, it doesn't do that.It looks like a black trapezoidal box, and the viewing angle is set. I suppose you could stick a pen or something under it to angle it differently, but again, that is more of a hack than a feature. It doesn't look wall mountable, but more of a counter/shelf thing. I am sure there will be 3rd party wall mounts for this which makes sense for a kitchen or something. The sound is pretty good from such a small footprint. To me, the original big echo has the best sound, but this is a close second. Also, when it is loud (like level 10) this seemed to hear us better to stop than the echo (where you sometimes have to yell to get alexa  on the regular echo to hear you over the music!)I don't always like to be an early adopter of things since version 2 of things is usually better somehow, and I am stuck with 1. But I really liked the idea of this and figured they could just update the software, not the entire device (like they have with tap now being able to turn on with just voice.) I hope they keep reading our suggestions and will consider the ideas of many of the folks who bought these.There really needs to be a forum for this product clickable from the echo device product pages! The only ones I found are on the "kindle forum" part of amazon (https://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?_encoding=UTF8&cdForum;=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&cdThread;=Tx20BQ8KTGP9S3Z)  ALL the forums/customer discussions are so hard to find now, that people resort to asking questions on the product pages, and no one wants to scroll through hundreds of questions to find something. If there were a dedicated forum, we could ask questions, find hacks and apps, etc.update: I chatted with customer service to see how to set up different ones of these on the same account, but in different locations. Apparently, it "drops in" in people using the device NAME, not phone number or anything. So I just named them for my family members and successfully connected with them with audio and video. I even dropped in on my cat who was home alone (I probably interrupted her secret alone cat rituals! ha ha!) I sort of like the ability to drop in on my house anytime from another device. There is also an alexa calling feature using phone number of contacts. You can use the Echo Show, Dot, and regular echo with that (only the show will have video, of course.) The main difference I see between the two is "drop in" automatically connects and calling announces a caller and you have to answer or ignore. You have a few seconds of blurry time on the camera to turn off the video for drop in if you want. Info for "drop in" is here:https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_left_v4_sib?ie=UTF8&nodeId;=202153130For calling, you can also push the video off icon if you are home dancing naked or something. :D  There are also do not disturb settings so you don't have to worry about someone dropping in on you when you don't want them to! If you are nervous about the camera being there at all, you can always get one of those sticker sliding webcam covers and keep control it like that.

B01J24C0TI	Can't get Show to make calls	I want to like the Show. The audio is great and the screen is beautiful. The main reason I bought it was for the calling capability and I can't get it to work. The app only imported 4 names from my address book. I verified that they do not own Alexa devices and all my relatives that do own devices - I know because I bought them - did not import. I have spent 2 hours on the phone with Amazon and talked to 3 people but no one has an answer. One person in tech support said that there is a problem with the app on Samsung phones.

It could not connect to my network, I called tech support but while I was calling I decided to reboot and start over. That corrected the problem. When it came back up it automatically connected and finished the setup.  The tech support was very nice and waited to make sure the rest of the setup completed.	V.

B01J24C0TI	Voice recognition is terrible compared to the original Echo	I hope they're able to improve the voice recognition. Compared to the original Echo, which seemed flawless, the Show does not understand our family nearly as well. We located the Show the same spot but will be bringing back the original. Alexa is not nearly as charming when she is this deaf and confused. Having to repeat yourself repeatedly and respond to incorrect actions suddenly starts to feel like one of the hellish automated voice response systems from Comcast or a credit card company found a way to sneak into your house.As for the rest of what Echo Show promises, you will feel like a beta tester. Amazon definitely pushed this out before it was ready. Time will tell whether that was the right call or not.

B01J24C0TI	Good, but needs some tweaks by Amazon to be great	This is a great upgrade from the original Echo, however, there are a couple annoyances and lost opportunities that I hope will be addressed in software updates. First, rotating suggestions about how you can use Echo appear on the screen. They even appear while the Show is doing other things, like on the "now playing" screen while playing music. There is a setting to control them, but you can't get rid of them completely. They are very distracting and unnecessary for some people, and I wish you could turn them off. Next, I'm not convinced that the sound is as good as the original, and there is no way to control the speaker bass or treble. Lastly, there is no option to display a simple monthly calendar on the screen. These are issues that I'm sure Amazon can address, and overall I am enjoying the Show, and it is definitely worth the extra cost over the Echo.	R.

B01J24C0TI	I'm in love	Echo devices have become a huge mainstay in my house that I use on a daily basis and I knew this new technology was something I needed to have. Just as I expected I have used this on a daily bass since day one. While it hasn't replaced my other Echoes it has added a different function for me to use. It sits on my nightstand so when I can't sleep I'm able to just turn on videos and watch til I'm tired. The screen doesn't seem too bright and I hardly notice it when I'm trying to sleep. I also love the video calls that I'm able to make and I'm surprised at how well this worked. The video didn't lag and the voice was clear, the only issue I had was that I needed more light in order for anyone to see me, that is not a design flaw just my room is darker than I thought. LolThe sound quality for movies and music is excellent and there's no distortion at all when you turn it loud. So far I haven't had any problems with videos lagging or anything. I did notice that when I try to play YouTube it does tell me that I have restrictions on and to turn them off in settings but I haven't found where that would be. I must be missing it somewhere but again that is my fault and not the device. I still have no problems watching the videos I want so I don't worry about it too much.I honestly can't wait to see what will be added to this as time goes on. For me, this device is exactly what I expected and I'm very happy with this purchase.

B01J24C0TI	Ill probably keep them but Im keeping my options open - I was hoping for all that and a bag of chips	 Ill probably keep them but Im keeping my options open - I was hoping for all that and a bag of chipsThe main reason I ended up purchasing the Echo Show is because of the integration with Camera feeds.  Mainly the Ring Doorbell Pro, Ring Flood Light Cam and Arlo Q.  All three of these work very well and are pretty quick. I'm able to view a live feed whenever I want since none of these are on battery.If you dont care about the Echo Show working with the Ring and Arlo products then you can stop reading this review now.Im not getting any motion alerts on the Echo Show with my Ring Products. It seems you have to be alerted by the Ring Chime or your Phone / Tablet that something is happening (motion alert / doorbell pressed) and then you can ask the Echo Show to show you the Front Door / Backyard to see whats going on.Im not sure this is a good thing. I guess if you only have one Ring device then you will be fine but if you have multiple then you wont know which device is currently giving you the motion alert.Ive been leaving an iPad on my nightstand with the Ring app open during the night so when I get a Ring Notification, I could just look over at the iPad and it would automatically pull up the camera feed from the device that was detecting motion without having to touch the iPad or say anything.The Ring app on the MAC is the same way. If you open the Ring app on a MAC and click the X it wont actually close all the way, it will just put an icon on the top toolbar. So whenever one of your devices detects motion, the camera feed will automatically open to show you. You don't have to click on anything.With the Echo show on your nightstand, you will need to hear the Ring Chime or the notification on your phone and then ask Alexa to show you the Front Door / Backyard to see the camera feed. Unless you look at your phone to see which device is detecting motion, I guess its a 50/50 chance you ask Alexa for the correct device.If you do put an Echo Show on your nightstand, you can ask Alexa to DO NOT DISTURB, and she will. This will disable the Drop In feature so people cant drop in on you while in bed. But you can still ask to see the Front Door / Backyard camera feeds.The Drop In feature is pretty good.  Takes 10 seconds or so for the camera feed to become clear so you can see whats going on.

B01J24C0TI	Needs an off switch for only camera that does not also turn off the microphone.	There is only one thing I hate about my new Echo Show.  There is no way to turn off the camera without turning off the  microphone.  I can't imagine there are not a lot of people like me who want to carry the Echo into the bedroom and bathroom and listen to music while taking a bath or shower or changing clothes. Not to mention bedtime fun for couples. Who wants a camera to be working under those circumstances?  Well, maybe a few people, but probably not most of us. This is a serious deficit in my book.I read that if you throw a towel over it, it gets confused.  Throwing a kleenex, which is translucent, seemed to work, but I haven't had it long enough to find out if that occasionally causes problems.

B01J24C0TI	Not as revolutionary as the original Echo - more evolutionary.	The Show is the next step in the evolution of the Echo. Not as revolutionary as was the original Echo, it is nevertheless a step forward. While there are bugs and omissions to work out, I am not bothered by software issues, as Amazon has done a great job improving and extending Alexa from day one. As the owner of one of the first Echos shipped, I have had a front row seat to this and fully expect it to continue.My complaints will be confined to the hardware as that will NOT be updated and improved with the next firmware release.My only major complaint is the the Show and thus, it's camera, cannot be reoriented. This angle it sits at is the angle it sits at, unless you use a book or some other workaround to alter it. So, the camera's view is of whatever it happens to be pointing at from where it's placed. I have one on a table beside my easy chair. It's a tall table, so when I do a video chat, the other person has a lovely view of the very top of my head. I also think that having a single button to turn off the camera and microphones is a mistake. I would prefer a second button for the camera, so that the camera could be turned off while still retaining voice usability.The camera should have been pivotable, or better yet, the entire Show should have been made with a adjustable base, to allow for different placement. Perhaps someone could market a rotating mirror that mounts above the camera so that the view can be adjusted. It could also have a black side to manually block the camera for privacy.BTW, I was one of those who were upset at the design when the first photos were released, remarking that it looked like something out of 1960's science fiction, but I have to admit that it grows on you.

B01J24C0TI	Unnecessarily Complicated and Android/I-Phone Dependent	I purchased two Echo shows in order to have video calls with my grandmother.  Amazon is less than transparent in explaining what is necessary to set the device up to make Alexa to Alexa calls.  In particular, a user must have either an Android smartphone or an I-Phone to set up the calling feature.  There is no support to set up video calling via a Windows PC, a Kindle Fire tablet, or a Windows Phone.  In addition, Amazon has chosen not to add a Skype skill that would allow more universal video calling.  It seems a little silly to market a smart-phone centered device as being accessible to an older population (few of whom own the latest smart-phones).  Likewise, it is not clear why Amazon has chosen to limit compatibility with Windows-based devices.  This device is pretty, but also pretty useless.

B01J24C0TI	Amazon, you should be ashamed! What a let down with this and the Echo!!!	WOW...Google Home Blows Echo Away.  "Alexa, what Amazons current stock price?" - "I am sorry, I do not know how to help with that."  "Ok Google, whats Amazons current stock price?" "As of close today Amazons stock price was $954.99....."  WOW, just WOW.  I You would think that Amazon would be able to do SO MUCH more, but I have come to think it is mostly used for shopping as it can look up even a very simple thing.  Even asking it when the first game of the 2017 NFL season is it has no clue.  Yet Google Home does...and in detail.  I have had an Echo from the time they came out and I have been waiting and waiting for it to improve.  I purchased the Show as I hopped they would have done more with it.  Nope, other than video items, it is still the dumb Echo.  AMAZON, you are BETTER THAN THIS.  Hire some real programmers and make these what they should be to todays world.  I have been waiting far to long for it to come of age, yet you all seem to be relying on developers to write things it can do.  What good is that as the developers do not things that people know about unless you go looking for it.  And they still can not help with just the most basic search for information. It does not even know how to shut off it's own screen when you ask it to..."What device?" it asks.  YOUR SCREEN.  "I am sorry, I can not find YOUR SCREEN".  How dumb is that really?	David B.

B01J24C0TI	Not Quite Ready For "Prime" Time	Having owned an original Echo from the beta testing period, I pre-ordered ordered two of the devices with great anticipation.  The Echo Show is easier to set up than the original, which is important, because there is very little documentation contained in the nicely designed packaging.  Amazon has successfully marketed this innovative product, and it does what it is supposed to, and does it well.  Consequently, there is little need to evaluate the features that were advertised.  Instead, I will report on some of what is problematic, in my opinion.Despite the 7" display, the Echo Show is primarily an audio device.  The screen is tiny compared with anything but a cell phone, and therefore watching a program beyond a few minutes is a bit of a chore.  The speakers are stereo, yet they somehow sound less full than the mono speakers on the original Echo.  I contacted Amazon to ask how to adjust the band equalizer, and the tech rep told me there was none.  Only volume control is possible, at present.  In that regard, the Show is an unfinished product and hopefully some kind of tone control will be forthcoming soon.The Drop-In feature also seems unfinished to me.  There does not appear to be a method for deleting contacts, which means people on your lists may be able to monitor conversations without much notice.  In my judgement, this represents a serious privacy issue, so be aware that after the initial (and subtle) tones, you may not know that someone is drop-in listening to your Show unit from afar.As a purchasing platform for Amazon, the Show is well-developed, as buying products is (perhaps too) easy.  I imagine that Amazon will be refunding many thousands of of items ordered by accident or by unauthorized customers.I think that Amazon owes its customers a bit of an apology for releasing a product that is not quite ready for prime (pun very much intended) time.  The Show needs a better screen, real audio controls, improved (or some) documentation and a lower price to live up to the hype.Amazon is one of the world's foremost pioneers in technology products.  In my judgement, it has the resources to do better and I expect that it will.

B01J24C0TI	Really awesome for Seniors!	We already have an Echo and an Echo dot, which have both become a part of our family. We use them all the time and loved them so I was really excited to get the Show. I primarily purchased it for my Dad who has Parkinson's and it has been working out great! He can ask Alexa to show him videos on YouTube, play books from Audible and get the weather, news etc. all without having to use his hands. He has been really frustrated trying to use remote controls, keyboards, tablets and the like with shaky hands and this has solved a lot of problems. He does have a shaky voice and Alexa is able to understand him. I really think this is a revolutionary product for people like my parents (my mom has Alzhiemer's.) They can easily read what is on the screen (it gives tips) and say those things. My Dad and I played Jeopardy on it last night and it was hilarious. I am very much looking forward to seeing how this device can enrich the life of our senior population. I showed it to my Dad's speech therapist and she thought it was genius and is already sharing it with her patients who have movement disorders.I am hoping to get a similar device for my brother so my Dad can call him and have video chats whenever he wants. I do wish Alexa would just let you call anyone and not just people with the Echo app but it's not that big of a deal for us personally. Also, if it would work with Fire tv that would be awesome too since my parents are not so good withe remotes and buttons. Overall, though, it's really great and we are enjoying it. I put pictures of my kids and niece on there for my Dad to look at as well.

B01J24C0TI	So much potential...	The device is MUCH better looking in person that it might appear in photos, with its shiny surface it looks sleek. What Amazon will do if it's thinking straight is add Netflix, DirectTV Now etc so that the device also functions like an IPTV. For me, that's the biggest potential - would be great on my desk to tune into CNN occasionally. Presumably, Roku is working on a Roku Show as we speak.Pros:- Bright clear display, great for viewing video- Same Alexa capabilityCons:- No audio out- Sound (contrary to what you may be told) is NOT as good as the full size Echo- No live TV feeds as of the time of writingSummary:Lots of potential, will spur development of knock-off IPTV devices - I think it's opened a new market.

B01J24C0TI	The original echo is better	I've had it for a few days and so far I am underwhelmed. You have to be so specific when you ask it to "show" you something that it's not very useful. The video call is an interesting feature if you have someone who doesn't know how to use their smartphone for video calls. I have multiple echos in my house and they say you can use it as an intercom but so far I haven't figured out how to make that work. I also can't find any way to name each device so someone can call it specifically (while keeping them on the same account). This would be far more useful if it connected to the TV. Who wants to watch amazon prime shows on a 7 inch screen? Not me. Its supposed to hook up with my arlo cameras, but that doesn't seem to work either. My advice is to wait until someone find something truly useful to do with it. If you're buying an echo for the first time I'd say stick with the original or the dot. This one seems like it would be cool, but so far it's definitely not.[Update] Amazon called me to to get more input. So it's at least promising to know they're paying attention. They also informed me that "intercom" is performed with the keywords "Drop in". So at least that function works in my house. At this point the screen and camera still don't add much value, but I'm hopeful they will at some point in the future.

B01J24C0TI	A little rough around the edges but it's going to be great	The main reason I got this was so I could monitor multiple kitchen timers visually without asking Alexa how much time is remaining on each one. At this time, the Echo Show is capable of showing 2 timers at once, and you can scroll the display to see more but I wish it could show at least 3 without scrolling. Obviously, it would be easy enough to do by making the font size smaller or tiling the timers horizontally and vertically on the screen (instead of just a vertical list as it is now). Also, the screen seems to go back to the home screen after an amount of time and I wish I could lock it to the timer screen while timers were running, this would be hugely helpful while cooking.The video features are pretty good so far as I'm able to ask Alexa to start a movie from prime video and starts playing effortlessly. The music feature with lyrics is very cool too, very similar to Fire TV.There is a button to digitally disable the microphone and camera, although I wish there was a built in physical shield that I could slide over the camera... for now I'm using a small cutout from a black post it note.I think it's an ideal product for your office desk, in your kitchen or even in a bathroom for getting news and weather during your morning routine. Overall, it needs some work and it's probably a little expensive for what it is right now, but I have a lot of faith that Amazon will cleanup some of the edges, add some of the little missing features and it will be amazing. If they can bring the price down, I'd probably get one for each of these locations. For now, it's dots all around.	gadgethog	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AFI2GX7CAYGC1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	16	4	2017/07/03

B01J24C0TI	Wish my mate hadn't bought it	Edit, a few days later: I added back one star. Why? Because the folks at Amazon went out of their way to contact me after publishing this review -- they wanted to talk more about shortcomings and changes I might like to see in the Show. AMAZING customer service, always. She also confirmed that I could hook up my original Echo next to the Show, give it a different wake-word, and use that specifically for playing music, which should help a lot. Also something else that I love about Amazon: They don't just bury bad reviews of their own products, like a lot of companies do. They go to work to improve the product.----------Updating after a few weeks. (My husband bought these, I was happy with the old Echos in our great room and our bedroom.)He seems to like it for some reason. I think seeing the weather is his killer app, or having a photo of our dogs as a wallpaper? IDK. We tried to pull up recipes from online, and Alexa had great difficulty finding them and then the screen kept going to black, which is super not helpful when you're in the middle of a recipe.The sound quality is... honestly, lousy. It's not great even if you're in front of the Show. I'm definitely listening to less music since we got it. But if you are NOT facing the Show, music is just bad, boxed-in distortion. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH that whoever wants the Show to succeed needs to create a decent 360-degree speaker peripheral -- like, yesterday. The Echo is the SOLE reason I migrated all my music over to Amazon, because of ease of voice access, huge access to music I don't own, and it helped that the original Echo's sound was just fine for my purposes. If Amazon had created a screen peripheral to the original Echo instead of making a unit that revolves around a unidirectional touchscreen/speaker, *that* might have been okay.Showing lyrics for songs is iffy at best -- mostly non-working. She'll tell you she doesn't have the lyrics for a particular track if you ask for them. I'm at the point where I wish I could hook up the original Echo next to the Show for the sole purpose of playing music. Okay, and interacting with, because I can see the original Echo's top ring of light from 3 different rooms......and that's gone with the Show. Bad flaw. You know how sometimes you call Alexa's name and she doesn't hear you? You can tell if she heard you on the original Echo. But you don't get any indication if you aren't facing the Show's screen. (Our most-used Echo is on a kitchen pass-thru and gets used throughout a great-room layout, so that's a problem.) The light ring was also a help in getting clued in that the wifi was having difficulties, and if it was trying to reestablish connection after a power fluctuation.I'm hoping we can use the drop-in feature to check on our dogs while we're out and let them hear our voices. Haven't tested it yet. Otherwise, ain't nobody droppin' in here. (Nobody ever really wanted videophones, guys.) Also, the Show should allow you to decide WHICH of your contacts you want it to have, to say the very least.At least having a new unit, PERIOD, did solve several incurable quirks our old kitchen Echo had developed (which the one in the bedroom never did)... for instance, suddenly being unable to recognize artist "Little Feat" and serving up some annoying "His Little Feet Christian Children's Choir" instead ::pokes ears out with forks::But I really kind of hate the Show.

B01J24C0TI	LOVE IT!!! Great device to help the family stay connected <3	I will start by saying that I got this as a gift and have previously own an Echo and a Dot; these are great devices as well, but I really enjoy the ability to make video calls and see my loved ones on the screen so for me it is totally worth the extra money. The other basic features are improved as well, for example if you ask for the weather you get a visual with the information per day on the screen, the daily flash briefing now includes video, when you play music you get to see the lyrics. The new features such as YouTube and Amazon Video are pretty cool too. This device is in its early days, Amazon has invented a new category, don't buy this if you expect it to be a tablet that talks or to have "apps", this is still a devices intended to be use with your voice and offers visuals as a complement. Still some stuff needs to get better such as recipes, but from my previous experience with Amazon products, they improve fast, I choose to take advantage of the $100 off promotion and give it a shot!	earlyadopter	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1BTDGSY8KNCMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	7	5	2017/07/03

B01J24C0TI	Nothing more than a Fire Tablet tied to AC and incapable of the most basic functions.	This thing isn't ready, not even close. I really wanted this to work. I thought, finally, I can use something for video chat and ordering from Amazon and getting information instead of using my smartphone. The setup is easy enough, you get a talk through and display that gets you connected quickly and then the device updates it's software. Everything after that is a disaster, let me explain.The first thing I wanted to do was change the alert word from "Alexa" to something else. I asked Alexa how to do that and was told to go to the Alexa app on the device I wanted to change. Hmmm, "Alexa, go to setup". "Sorry, I can't help you with that". "Alexa, show me the setup screen". Youtube starts up.  One more time. "ALexa, setup".  Ding. (the little sound). A really bad start trying to do something so simple. Then I tried to search for things, nothing way out, like a recipie for baking a Peach Apple pie. Instead of seeing recipes I am asked if I want to load some app for which I have no idea if it allows access to my network, my contacts or any other information. I don't even know if it will cost me additional money. I try it anyway. A bad move on my part. I choose a recipe and want to scroll down to see the directions so I say "Alexa, scroll down". "I'm sorry, I can't help you with that". "Alexa, go down one page". "Ding, nothing.It seems what Amazon did was simply load the smartphone Alexa app onto Echo Show and push it out the door. The whole purpose of using Echo Show is to free up the hands and interact with it by voice and thus bring a new dimension into using Amazon and it's services. It simply doesn't work. Another example. I have several Fire enabled TVs so I should be able to connect them in some way, Amazon says so and so does the initial setup screen which it seems you can never get to again. When it showed all my Fire enables devices and I chose one of the TVs I was prompted to enter the code display on the TV's display. Great except there is no such code displayed. So I go into all the setting for the Fire dongle and no code is there. It is these simple things that are either non-existent or so poorly implemented that there is no way this product is ready for general use.I bought two of these with the idea of buying several more to give to family members. While it works for very simple things like asking about the weather, anything else is pure frustrations. One ore example:I asked "Alexa, what is the stock price for Amazon?" The answer is, "I'm sorry, I can't help you with that"? So I ask for business news and what I get is the same canned display and run through of Reuters news brief that comes on anytime something I ask for has the word news in it. As this doesn't work, the software is obviously nothing more than a copy paste affair, I am returning both Echo Show devices. If I am going to be forced to use three buttons, Power, up and down then I might as well just use a tablet. I expected at least specific software or software that is aware of what device it's running on and then provide services and capabilities to get the most out of that device. As this is now, it is nothing more than a large, very heavy, AC cord tethered 7" Fire Tablet in a desk sized case. No thanks, maybe some time in the future but then everyone else is coming out with better stuff too.Mr. Bezos, are you listening?

B01J24C0TI	Good, but young product. Needs a way to completely turn off screen.	This REALLY needs a night mode where the screen completely shuts off. Even with the current "Off" mode, the screen is still very bright at night. I've needed to turn this off every night due to this. Interested to see how Amazon remedies the many complaints about this.

B01J24C0TI	Good but I'm hoping context recognition improves	After using two of the recently released Echo Shows for a few days, I'm somewhat satisfied. Setup was very easy, and since the Show has a touchscreen, you no longer have to use your phone to get this Echo running. The sound and screen are good. It's really nice to see song lyrics displayed, since we usually play music on ours. Videos on YouTube are fun, and integration with Prime video streaming is nice too. So far I'm disappointed in the context recognition. On my phone, I can see how the Alexa service faithfully understood and transcribed what I said but the device then does something unexpected. Try this yourself by viewing the news items that flash by on the bottom of the display (unless you turn them off). If you don't phrase your request exactly the way it prompts you, there's no telling how it'll respond. For instance, there was a featured news story about Germany and marriage equality. The [correct] prompt displayed was "Alexa, tell me about marriage". But when I asked "Alexa, tell me about marriage equality in Germany", the device instead read a different featured news story about a festival founder being arrested. There were no similar overlapping words. I think maybe it's taking us a while to get used to how the Echo Show requires you to phrase requests in order for it to understand us. We've used an standard Echo for about a year now and enjoyed it We then bought an Echo Dot and were less impressed with the voice pickup (often it understands my wife but not me). The Show seems to hear us just fine, and I'm hoping the voice context will improve.

B01J24C0TI	Another great device from Amazon - wish it could do more - and perhaps it soon will	I am a big fan of Amazon's gadgets.  Have owned Echo devices for several years.  So I was thrilled that a screen has been added.  So far though, I haven't found enough content that utilizes the screen in such a way that it makes this 5 stars.  The ability to video chat with other Echo Show or Alexa App owners is nice, as is watching Amazon content, and I gave it an extra star for those capabilities.  Having some issues with it pulling up my calendar when I ask it to show my calendar.  But if I ask what my next appointment is, the display will show a scroll of my calendar events.  These little quirks will get resolved but it is a little frustrating.  Would also love ability to watch ESPN via a subscription or live morning news while in the kitchen or getting ready in the morning.  Either I haven't figured out how to do that, or it isn't able to  - yet.  And that is why I love the Echo products.  The possibilities are exciting.  The price point is worth the exploring and taking the journey.

B01J24C0TI	Serious limitations	We've had the original Echo since it was available to Prime Members. We liked it and found it useful. I bought the Show as a replacement for the original, but is is not.  While the Echo's sound output was omnidirectional the Show projects all the sound in one direction, from the front only.  This is an issue for us as we located it on the divider between the kitchen and dining room where the Echo worked well for both rooms, but the Show does not.  The other deficiency, and it is major, is that the Show can't 'hear' commands when music is playing, even though the music is not very loud.  I have to turn the Show's volume way down to allow it to respond to 'Alexa' voice commands - a major inconvenience. It is so bad that when I shouted 'Alexa' at the Show, an Echo Dot, which is three rooms away responds, but the Show does not until the volume is reduced to less than a whisper.  I hope Amazon is working on updates to improve this deficiency.	A Fan	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2AV8OO4QY1G5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	17	2	2017/07/03
B01J24C0TI	Absolutely Awesome	This is without a doubt the most amazing little gadget I have. I already own the first generation of "Alexa" and Echo Dot....so when this came out, was a no brainier for me. I love everything about it...video calls, music, movies, shopping, recipes; etc. The list goes on and on. The sound is outstanding. I have watched movie trailers, shopped. Used video calls, and to think this is right on my kitchen counter and works amazingly. Was so easy to set up too. Can't wait to see the updates and the different things she may do it the future....thank you Amazon for creating such wonderful devises for the home...I will "stay tuned" for the future of Alexa....will most likely buy these for my children for Christmas too....absolutely love it...

B01J24C0TI	Definitely a beta version	Overall, it's nice because of the picture/video. However, you cannot pick which contacts you want to have for calls and cannot control it. I had to call and disable the feature. This was one reason why I bought it. The speaker is not very good for video, when someone is talking.,It's fine to listen to music.

I can watch Youtube and Amazin videos. I like the suggestions which helps to get to know the device. I bought two. I live in a townhouse and now I can view the downstairs area from my upstairs bedroom. I gave it four stars because I would like to be able to turn off the tips and view only my famiky photo slide show. I would also like the option to turn off the screen when not in use or during bedtime. The screen does dim after no activity but not enough to be completly dark. The time clock continues to illuminate but why should it when all I have to do is ask Alex what time is it. It needs some work but I sm so glad to have this device. I moved the Echo to snother room. The echo show does it all and with video!	Family	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2OWKL8ZS6VQHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/07/02
B01J24C0TI	A few upgrading ideas for Amazon and the Echo Show.	Great improvement over the original echo which I have owned since released.  Instead of placing another review which many people have done already let me post some good ideas for software upgrades.  At the bottom of the screen where Alexa places the usual color bar that used to be the colored rings on the original.  A software upgrade would be nice where if you have a missed message instead of the right hand corner icon make the line at the bottom of the screen blink green like the top ring does on the original.  For a missed call maybe another color on the bottom and a third color for missed call and message.  Another possible upgrade would be for anyone having more than 2, or even for more than 2 with friends and family the ability to have a party type call where the screen would then have half size or quarter size pictures instead of the full screen for a party or 3 way call. Also for anyone having the Alexa show and echo when a call is made to the show a ring audible to the original echo in case you are in a different room.  The messages now go to both, no reason the ring shouldn't, just some ideas.. A slide shutter for the camera might be nice instead of shutting the camera or blocking it with something so you can keep drop in enabled on the show.  It's new and I know it will evolve.Great unit.

B01J24C0TI	Echo show meets expectations	I've only been using the echo show for a few days but it definitely provides me with that visual I sometimes really need that the echo or echo dot doesn't provide. Purchases are nice to visually confirm what I'm buying and the touch screen is enjoyable to use and doesn't feel cheap. I would enjoy a larger screen but I have this set right next to my rocking chair. We have a newborn at home so our hands are always full so it's great to play a video without needing to touch anything. I'm sure Amazon will add the ability for other streaming services (hopefully). The sound is nice for music and the suggestions on the screen are helpful while I learn about new features. Looking forward to more skills developed for the echo show.	Kevin V.

B01J24C0TI	Dreadful	This product fails on so many levels.

B01J24C0TI	Cool But Still Trying to Figure Out How We Can Use It	Echo Show is a brand new product and still trying to find its role in life. The technology is beautifully employed and a lot of our earlier stated shortcomings aren't in fact true. So its versatility is increasing every day as we learn more about what it can and cannot do.Some examples of misconceptions we held:The camera can be turned offWe believed it couldn't...that only the mic was muted when placed into a sort of standby state. We were wrong. Enabling the 'Mic off' button also disables the camera.We can set it up for our elderly parents use even when they don't use cellphonesWe erroneously assumed that they would need to have a cell phone with Data Plan to use the Show for video calls to us. You do need a cellphone to setup that feature but not to use it.One thing I think the Show has going for it is a very enthusiastic team of people behind it who love technology and want to see it succeed. We received a call from them asking if we had any questions and that call helped us to understand a lot more about how it works and what the  future may hold. That call helped us to realize that much of what the Show needs to improve upon is simply software based and I'm confident improvements will be forthcoming.Examples of this include navigating both YouTube videos and  Amazon videos. Right now the interface leaves a lot to be desired but simple software updates undoubtedly streamline this process in the future.A few things that would absolutely improve Show's versatility for us include:*  The ability to either copy very long Amazon passwords from somewhere or to use 2 Factor authentication so you don't need to use such long complex passwords that are difficult to enter manually.* The ability to sign in to your Google account for tracking your YouTube history* The addition of TV channels similar to those used by Amazon Fire TV....so Netflix, HBONow, etc.* The ability to stream content your watching on Fire TV...so the Show would act as an auxiliary device so you could be watching something on a big screen and not have to interrupt it by going into the kitchen to prepare a snack or meal.There's one feature that all Echo devices are lacking that seems fairly simple to me to  include. It's also one of the most requested features...yet it has never been addressed that I know of by Echo's developers. Alexa needs to be able to conduct Google searches. (Or Bing  searches.)  This would increase its utility be volumes!  Frankly I don't get why this has yet to be incorporated into Echo and I'll be very sad if it never is.	vsajewel	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A3229OTKN7P8AJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	4	2017/07/02
B01J24C0TI	Careful before you buy	Initial review: one starWe heavily use our Amazon Echo and love it. It's in the kitchen and main usage is for music. We have Music Unlimited for free on this device (without us even noticing it).Our expectation for the Echo Show was to at least be able to do the same features as the regular Echo. But it doesn't since we are now asked to pay a full Music Unlimited ($7.99/month) in order to get the same service.Amazon, what a scam! You should be ashamed! I'm returning it immediately!Edit: 3 starsEcho support team called me to understand my feedback. They activated my Unlimited Music account (one device $3.99/month) on the new device. I wouldn't say they saved the day, but at least I'm getting the same service with my new device.Looking forward to discovering new services and further increase my review!	Nicolas C.

B01J24C0TI	Where is the speaker button when dropping in on an Echo Show?	Would have gave it a 5th star except for this huge oversight.  When using the Drop in feature on any other device your cell phone app has a speaker button.  When you drop in on the Echo Show the speaker button goes away and you get a button to disable video.  One might argue the only device you need a speaker button for is the show because it is the only device you need to communicate with while looking at your smart phone.  So now I have a video communication device that can only see my ear while using my smartphone.  Huge oversight guys!

B01J24C0TI	I love it!	I love it!!  Because I'm so completely and enthusiastically satisfied with the Echo Dot, I pre-ordered the Show and have had it for 3 days now.  Installation was a snap and it connected itself to the Alexa app automatically.  I'm sure I'll find a zillion uses for it -- so far, I think it's great to be able to actually see my shopping list on the screen and I guess I just like "seeing" (as opposed to hearing) the weather, the name (amd lyrics) of the song that's playing and other things.  I just happened to find out about the "messaging" feature on Echo today and it works perfectly on this and the Dot.  I must say, I'm especially excited about having cameras at the front and back doors -- I've got two cameras on their way to me.  Once I have it all checked out and am using all the things it can do, I'll buy them for my grown nieces so they can talk to each other while they're making dinner (or whatever) in different towns.  Amazon does everything so extremely well and this is easily up to the very high standard they've created and we've all come to expect.  The Show is nice and heavy, so it's not going to be knocked off the table.  In that I happen to sit right here beside it a lot of the time, I'd like to be able to make the rolling prompts (for videos, etc) stop and let the screen just be dark -- sure as shootin' there's a setting or command for that, so I'm unconcerned.  Yes indeed, I love the Show!!!  I have to believe you will, too!!!	Scott B.

B01J24C0TI	Room for improvement	I bought two and both have been plagued with connectivity issues.  I suspect it is a software issue as none of my other wifi devices, including Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, are having issues connecting.  I have yet to see the benefit of the screen, except for video calling, which also leaves something to be desired.  I suspect the screen will be better incorporated into responses with subsequent firmware upgrades.  I think there is a lot of potential for the Echo Show, however I would recommend holding off on the Echo Show purchase for now.

B01J24C0TI	Well worth the upgrade from a Dot or for anyone's first Echo purchase	I've had a couple of days with my Echo Show and overall I really am enjoying the features. Currently, we have 4 Echo Dots around the house (5 Echo devices now) as we've heavily added automation such as lighting, plugs, air conditioners, Nest and door locks to name some of what Echo helps us with. While the Echo Show doesn't really add any value to these devices yet it's still a great step up and Amazon is constantly adding functionality. Cannot wait to see what the Echo Show evolves into!The video feature, especially for video calling is by far my favorite and it's been used quite a bit. Having an intercom like feature to give the ability to communicate with my Echo Dots is pretty sweet! Gone are the days of my wife yelling something from the other room in what sounds like some alien voice that I can never really hear eventually leading to me getting up or her coming to me. Now she just calls.Personally, I love the screen and I think the size is just right. I've heard people commenting about the video quality and/or screen resolution, but this device was absolutely not designed to watch movies on. It is pretty neat however that you can. Where the video ability really makes me giddy is when searching for a movie for movie night. In the past, it was pointless to ask about movie times on the Echo Dot as I'd most always end up on the computer or cell to get more info and/or to see a trailer. Now it's totally Echo Show! Ask for showtimes and a list of movie posters appears. Click a poster and all the information you could want is right there including movie trailers!Everyday activities such as weather, traffic or asking questions are very nicely enhanced with the use of being able to see as well as hear. Speaking of hearing, the audio quality is pretty good as well. It's not Bose, but then again if it were the price would be much higher. Added bass is nice over the original Echo as well. When upgrading from an Echo Dot it is, of course, a huge difference as well as being able to remove the Bluetooth speaker I had connected to the Echo Dot.I love the wallpapers and when using the Amazon photo storage you can have a slideshow with all your favorite pictures in the background. I noticed a few comments about how the photos don't look right, but this is not an Echo Show issue, but rather user error. How so you ask? Well, we pretty much live in a 16:9 aspect ration world now so if taking pictures in portrait mode they simply are not going to fill the Echo Show screen. Landscape mode for video and photos is the only way to go if you ever expect to view your content on anything other than your phone. Since I exclusively use landscape mode when taking photos and videos everything viewed on my Echo Show displays perfectly!I've got to be fair and dim the lights a little on this glowing review as there are a few things I don't really like. First and foremost, the way the device sits, at least how I have mine sitting, leaves a TON of headroom when doing video calls. The device really needs to be tilted forward a good bit to have me framed, but I get it. I'm sure the camera is tilted up for people who might use it in the kitchen or in areas where you might be standing. A simple "kickstand" added to the back would solve this and give the option for a more centered camera view or one looking up. If this bothers anyone else, check out this link for a solution:  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XCLYL53/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1I stacked the rubber feet 4 deep. One stack on the back left and right side and one stack in the back middle. Perfect camera position for my use (sitting with the Echo Show on a table to my left). Even doing this, the device is still very stable and isn't high enough to make it tilt or fall forward.It's new so there are still some bugs. Recently when my dad calls me from his Echo Show to mine it was ringing on my cell phone instead of my Show. Very frustrating as it had been working just fine. Also, a new notification icon (circle with what looks like a person) has appeared in the upper top right and for the life of me, I simply could not clear this from my screen. A quick call to Echo support and a device reboot cleared up the calling issue and the notification icon should be working in the next update.Lastly, before I turn the brightness back up is the drop in feature. Unless I'm doing something wrong, avoid this feature at all costs! In its current state, if someone is allowed to drop in do not expect any privacy as after a few seconds your screen is no longer blurred to the other person and they can see everything going on! It was my understanding you had to voice accept a drop in but doesn't appear to be the case. Imagine the horror of dropping in on someone doing the nasty or even worse - them dropping in on you!Personally, I think it's another great Amazon product and well worth the upgrade. Will I replace all of my Echo Dots with Echo Shows... no, not at all, but my wife wants one for her area so we'll have at least two!

B01J24C0TI	Connectivity Issues Get In the Way	Has potential but going to be sending back mainly for connectivity issues. Accessing my Spotify account on the Echo was never a problem but the Show seems to have lots of difficulty. For other commands there seems to be a big lag at times and often Alexa tells me that she is having trouble connecting but will still keep trying. I connected my phone to the Bluetooth and any time something makes a noise on my phone it will stop any music on the Show and then the Bluetooth screen shows up - I disconnected the BT but never had that problem on the Echo. I have to then ask to play music again or give the command of what ever was playing prior to the interruption. I have tried restarting and connecting to both 2.4 and 5 ghz but to doesn't seem to solve it. As others have mentioned, the continuous scrolls are annoying and would hope they would issue the option to turn those off.On the plus size the speakers are very nice and the other visual capabilities look nice, but can only do so much if I can't stay connected. I'm going to try an exchange in the off chance I got a lemon but based on some of the other reviews it sounds like this isn't uncommon.

I was able to get my lights set up with it as well as my home video cameras. One think I don't love is that the one that sits on my desk at work, someone can just say, "Alexa, show me my family room" and my office can spy on me so I wouldn't mind some kind of way to protect this but otherwise it is pretty sweet. My kids love it when I call from my desk at work and are always eager to pick up.	familyman1	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1J78A0D3K0410/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	5	2017/07/02

B01J24C0TI	This is the one to buy if you want Alexa	I already had an Echo, and a Dot, and just got the Show because my son wanted it.  I really didn't think the video screen was a big deal.  But, I have to admit, the screen really adds to the whole concept of Alexa.  It pops up with events on your calendar, your local weather, news, and lots more.  My son and I who live over 700 miles apart already made a video call using the Show and it's much better than using Facetime.  The $100 off deal for buying 2 is would swayed me to buy it now and I really think it's a significant improvement over the other Amazon Alexa devices.  I would recommend it as the one to buy if you want an Amazon Alexa device.

B01J24C0TI	Does exactly what it is designed to do.	It's perfect. Does everything echo does and adds a screen so it's a little more useful. In my opinion, most complaints are due to lack of knowing how to work things or expecting more than an echo.I can't find any fault. I bought two, one for me and one for my adult son, who has the dot, and I love the show so much and find it useful enough that I just ordered another one.If your familiar with echo and know what it is designed to do, the show takes it a little farther.

Yes it has a touch screen which almost makes it less attractive such as the daily deals and other features. It's brand-new so if Amazon does what they have done with other products I'm sure  there will be enhancements and other upgrades made to truly make this an essential household "device".

B01J24C0TI	Nice product with one glaring design problem	Functionally, so far I think this review deserves more stars.  I think there's a lot of POTENTIAL here.  This replaces the old "Kitchen TV" and takes the Echo to a level of a functional information hub.  That said, this is something that sits in my KITCHEN.  This is something that sits in the middle of FAMILY TIME.  I don't always want a scrolling "stupid headlines of the day" feed.  I don't always want an in your face connection to "the rest of the world" that I cannot turn off.  The device needs a setting to get rid of the scrolling feed, or to radically customize it to what's actually wanted - the weather, the temperature of various rooms, what's running in the house, etc.  It needs an equivalent of VIDEO MUTE.  The genius of the audio-only version of the Echo is you aren't conscious of its presence until you ask for it.  This is where Amazon blew it.  YOU KNOW IT'S there with the Echo Show.	da burg	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2ZQZTR1FCPYMR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	3	2017/07/02
B01J24C0TI	Great "household hub"	A month or so ago, we *almost* bought a smart refrigerator.  At first we laughed when we saw it, but then we became very interested in all the things it could do.  We ended up not purchasing it - it cost $500 more than the refrigerator we bought.  Then we learned about the Echo Show.  It seemed to have all the things that drew us to the smart fridge, but smaller and could play music.  And it was less than half the price.  Right now, we're using it for weather forecasts, a grocery list, a to-do list, and music. We haven't bought the unlimited Amazon music yet - just what's available through Prime so far.  We like the variety as of now.  The Echo Show can do so much more, and has the potential for even more skills as time go on.  We look forward to seeing what develops!

B01J24C0TI	With some additional capabilities it will be 5 stars.	Updating my review to 4 stars.  Originally it was not clear how to adjust settings on the screen, that was my main issue, with the latest update from Amazon it provided the details I was missing on how to manage the screen.  I kept looking for these as well as the initial command to sleep did not appear to work, it does now.Have now used this to replace my alarm clock and move my original echo out of the bedroom into the living room.5 stars will come when I can change the visual settings on the clock as well as select more random pictures than what is uploaded.Much happier than when it first arrived, if you want an echo with display it is worth it for the additional price.When the ECHO first came out I jumped on it and am glad I did.  Mostly I use it for music, news, alarms, weather, and the occasional fact related question (most the time Alexa doesn't have an answer).I did the same for TAP and TAP follows me around the house when I am working outside, again mostly music but having Alexa nearby is helpful.Show, I think could be very good but some things I still haven't figured out:1.  No easy way to figure out the timeout on the display.2.  Limited home screen choices, great I can add pictures but it would be even better if I could configure a few things to display what is important to me.3.  Backlight - want to use it to replace my alarm clock but the backlight has a lot of bleed and can't dim it (at least have not found a way to control the backlight)Haven't tried calling and looking forward to that when a few in the family get one.  The fact is, it will likely be very good but needs some better management capabilities in the Alexa app and through voice commands.

B01J24C0TI	Breakthrough Tech; Unlimited Potential	Two words: The Future. The time is here in which we will all soon have "that device" in our homes, and this is it-- you know, the one we got a glimpse of from Marty McFly's house in "Back to the Future 2".While it's so much more advanced than even the Echo Dot, Alexa is slowly but surely learning how to make our lives so much easier. As more and more home tech comes available, she'll be able to control that much more-- The latest? Now she can show you what's happening on your front porch, or in your baby's room, with a simple sentence request integrating your Ring doorbell/camera system.Yes it's new, so it has a couple glitches (thus the 4 stars). But overall it's an Echo Dot times 10, and in time, Alexa will be almost as capable as the "Computer" is in Star Trek (and now you can even change her name to "Computer" if your inner Trekkie so desires :)	David in Dallas	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1KGHG7OG7O1BJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/07/02
B01J24C0TI	Great Concept, but major smart home connectivity issues	Alexa is great, and the voice recognition is incredible. Takes a learning curve on how phrase requests, but overall user friendly. My biggest complaint, and it's a BIG one, is after spending 3 days attempting to connect my smart bulbs (HUE and WeMo), talking with Amazon support, etc. NONE of my smart bulbs have been able to be connected. This is almost a deal breaker for me. If I can't get it figured out soon. I may return them both.

B01J24C0TI	Adds a nice capabillty to Echo	Had it for 3 days. This is our third Echo product. We have a standard Echo and Dot and now the show.It's cool to see what you are listening to or various info like you shopping list on the screen. News weather etc. So the screen is a plus.Using it to video call the grandkids is fun. Very high-quality video. The sound is OK, but I'm still having it connect to my Bluetooth speakers. They are better that the self-contained speaker. Other than that, if you like having Echo or Alexa around there isn't anything to not like about the show.My wife says it should be battery operated for mobility.

B01J24C0TI	Excellent New Product to replace the Bricked Sony Dash.	This is a very new product and I've only had it 2 days, but so far my experience has been great. It is replacing a Sony Dash that I was gifted in 2011. Seems odd to me that this product goes on sale 2 days before Sony bricked my Dash, but all well. So far the Echo show has been a hit. I normally have it on my nightstand, but last night I put it in the dining room during a dinner party and it was the hit of the party. Everyone kept asking the Echo questions and asking for jokes. (the jokes were the hit of the party). I must say that the voice recognition is excellent. This isn't tech from the early 2000's . I didn't have a single misunderstood word to the Echo. I got six years out of the Dash, and I hope to get many, many years of use out of the Echo. The instructions that come with the Echo are a joke. Pretty much say "Plug it in, connect to the internet, download the smart phone app, and start using the Echo" , and that's it. There is a learning curve, but I think that with the Echo's on screen hits and tips that it should be fairly easy to learn. The alarm clock sound are okay, but there are not many to choose from. I'm hoping that in the future that more alarm sound choices are added. The camera features seem to work very well. Picture quality is excellent.  The touch screen reacts to the light in the room auto dimming in low light, and the touch feature of the screen works very well. The ease of use of the "drop in" feature is very easy to use from the smart phone. Over time the calling features of this device should be excellent, but at this time it is hard to comment on the calling features as the unit has only been on sale for about 4 to 5 days and I don't know anyone else that has one yet. As far as I can tell, you can only call other people that have a Echo device (The Dot and up to the Show) , but not a cell or land line. I could be wrong about that , but again that goes to the lack of documentation that doesn't come in the box with the Echo Show. Many of the Echo Show's feature are tied into Amazon Prime (music and video come to mind right away) so it appears that you get much more use out of the built in features if you have a Prime account.  I haven't tried any of the home automated commands yet, because I don't have a Ring doorbell, Nest thermostat, or Hue lights (yet). Where the packaging is concerned, it was packaged very well, with no transit damage (as it should be) . The unit came out of the box wrapped in a protective film keeping the unit spotless until unwrapped by myself. same with the power plug and cord. The unit has an excellent finish and a hefty feel to it that scream quality. If there is a need in the future, I will update the review, but at this time I have to say "Great job Amazon !!"

B01J24C0TI	So far so good.	Let me preface this review by saying that I've only had this item for a few days and that it still has a lot of room to grow. The main reason for the positive review is that everything works essentially as expected, there are a few really cool new features, but my main excitement is the expectation that more and more third party skills will incorporate video functions. The device has great speakers and a nice display. I have high expectations for this product as it evolves.	mschlee	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AAG6TD14L6ZDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2017/07/02

B01J24C0TI	A work in progress.	Overall a nice piece of hardware with some glitches. I like to have the show shut its screen down when done using it.  It does that well unless you have had it just adjust your house thermostat. Then it will keep asking what device. It does not even understand when you say Alexa, shut down the echo show's screen. Keeps asking which device. After maybe 10 minutes it forgets about the device and will shut its screen off.  I trust Amazon will give this device more and more refining.	Greg G.

B01J24C0TI	Video is a great addition for Alexa.	I have had the Echo Show for almost a week.  We really like it.  A good test in my household is that my wife always raises her eyebrows when I bring in new tech and asks; "Do we really need that?"  If she buys in a short time later, than it's a home run.  My wife does like the show after a couple days.  Here's a couple random points.  First, I'm really tired of the media characterizing Drop-In as "creepy."  It is not creepy, it is very convenient and makes a lot of sense. It is an opt in feature and won't make sense for everyone, but we have two and use them as room to room intercoms and with or without video, the drop in makes that work. Many people will point out that there are many things they wish could  do and can't.  This is true. But, more features will come and there are many very cool things you can do. For instance, ask Alexa to use Youtube and show naturescapes video.  It shows you several choices and you choose one. We have an original Echo and we have Dots and the one feature I've always wanted was for them to all play the same music at the same time.  Sadly, that feature is still missing.  Anyway, Echo Show does what it's suppose to, it's very cool and easy to use and is a great step forward for Alexa.

B01J24C0TI	Sending it back	The Echo Show will probably work well for some people, but it's not for my family. We put it in the kitchen and were constantly distracted by the screen. Every time I went into the room I'd find myself looking at the screen for no reason except that it was on. We use our Echo mostly for listening to music and setting timers. The screen is just too much of distraction and doesn't add value for the things we use our Echo for.

It even allows you to tell it to stop teaching and just wait for commands.

B01J24C0TI	Still in beta - needs more work	I love my Echos and thought the Echo Show would make a great kitchen companion. Unfortunately, it has one tragic flaw that needs to be addressed. The Echo Show will always revert back to its home screen, regardless of what you want. Want to set multiple cooking timers and keep them on screen for a quick glance? Sorry, it's going back to news headlines, calendar items, and the occasional timer reminder. How about that complicated recipe you are cooking from AllRecipes.com? Sorry, but the Echo Show is going to time out after a minute and you'll need to search for that recipe all over again. Need to pause that YouTube instructional video so you can duplicate the steps? Don't keep it paused too long or you are going back to the home screen.	mikeisflash	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/ASEG93UMRH2AV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	13	2	2017/07/02

B01J24C0TI	I really like this device, but...	I really like this device, but for security sake it would have been thoughtful to have a sliding camera blocker built in.  While I recognize that I can turn off "Drop-in" in the Alexa app, there's still something unsettling about the sole use of this feature for camera view security in today's Internet of Things (IoT) environment.  In the short term, I decided to make my own camera blocker by using a piece of the black cardboard included in the packaging to create a velcro-backed cover that I can put on or take off as needed.  Meanwhile, as a more permanent solution, I will explore webcam covers available on Amazon.com.	cp	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A24KFDDYF2CTTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/07/02
B01J24C0TI	Meh... I think I prefer the original...	I have to say I think I prefer the original.  I find the Echo Show to be intrusive, in that the screen is always scrolling some sort of nonsense that I have no interest in. I feel like I'm being spammed all day with the "tips" and any news on the screen always requires you to ask Alexa for more info. It would be a much better product if Amazon would allow you to set the home screen to just display time and temperature.  Hopefully they will give us the opportunity to set the home screen as we like-right now that's not an option.  I can see me unplugging the Echo Show and giving it away and going back to the original if we can't configure the device to our own preferences.

B01J24C0TI	An echo with video but poor quality video	I love the Echo I have 3, the main reason I got the show was the video capabilities. These disappoint. On a network where I had no issues with Facetime and streaming video such as ESPN, the echo Show frequently drops or has long pauses where I can't understand the other party.  I should have saved money and gotten a non video version	B. A Wobbe	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A30EAQBR3KDPF3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	3	2017/07/01
B01J24C0TI	The best Alexa/ Echo yet	The Echo is awesome - sure it may not understand everything you throw at it but take some time to learn key commands and this thing saves time, makes things easier and is a great addition to our kitchen. We have our nest cams for the kids bedrooms that I can bring up, I can watch a movie or ask for my news video to play	Mr. P.

B01J24C0TI	Good hardware but the software needs work.	Rather than detail the virtues of echo devices as a whole, which you likely already own, I thought it might be more useful to offer info on what the show does differently than the cheaper echo devices (echo, tap, and dot).  Is it worth the money and space or are you better off with something else?This is an early review, I've had the device since launch, but I will be updating it as things go along.The first thing you notice when unboxing the device is the contrast in weight and angles, the device is heavier and more boxy than other echo devices and resembles a small TV or the earlier internet connected devices like Sony Dash or Chumby.  It's pleasing to the eye and the guts of the device shrink behind the 7" screen and the bottom speakers.  The screen itself is pleasing to look at, there's no prominent light bleed or color issues but it's not anything to really praise.  The lack of OLED, while understandable for the price, is disappointing but only notable when in the do-not-disturb or screen off mode where the screen goes black save for a white time display (and a moon when in DND).  The speakers are really nice themselves though; on par with the regular echo (It fills the space a little less though).The show does all that you'd expect of an echo - answering questions, listening to music, shopping, etc - and a few new things like watching videos (from YouTube and Amazon Video as well as news and trailers), video calls, and new skills that take advantage of a screen (e.g. "Show me the front door" will display video from Nest, Arlo, etc cams that you've called 'front door').  Everything is still controlled with your voice although there are opportunities to interact with touch.  Unfortunately, at this time, the touch interactions feel shallow and often incomplete.  For example, if you get a message a notification pops up that you can tap on and it will display a list of household users and the number of messages each person has but you can't tap on a name to see more information, you have to ask for it to play messages and then when it does it doesn't show you the text of those messages, even when they were sent as text.  It's disappointing and confusing as an interface.Videos look nice and have little load time but the limited services and lack of browsing opportunities limit the use right now.  The recently added calls and drop-in feature really shine here and the slow video fade in is a nice touch for drop-in.  Playing music gets a boost with on screen album art and lyrics if available.  Certain skills get a handy boost from the screen as well providing visual feedback.  Uber and Allrecipies have been my favorites thus far.  Amazon also does a nice job of featuring skills that have been enhanced for the show for you to try out.While not in use the screen generally displays two pages.  One page displays the time, weather, news, feature tips and timers if they're being used, the other just time, news, and feature tips.  They cycle through the display at about 5 seconds and update information periodically.  These screens are customizable in the slightest at this point and it feels like a missed oppertunity.  The information is useful but it'd be nice to limit it to a single page and always have weather and timers up or to change sizes of things for visual impairments.The user interface itself, as a whole, feels poorly designed with sparse details and a complete lack of configuration.  Weather displays the current temp on one page, then high and low on another, then the next 4 days on another, then the 3 days past that on yet another, and finally the RealFeel, precipitation, and wind on still yet another screen.That's not to say the device is bad but when faced with the choice of this or the $50 echo or even $170 cheaper dot you're paying a premium for the screen.  And that premium, at least right now, is of questionable use.  If you're already planning to drop for the cost of an echo the $50 more for the show might be worth the risk but for anyone with an echo or considering a dot then it's a much harder sell right now.  Amazon has shown a dedication to improving these devices though so I've got almost no concern that this will improve but they also introduce new and often cheaper devices as well and I'm not sure what would win out here in a race.  While things like the echo dot are almost at a compulsion level of benefit for the cost this just isn't there, yet.  If you're in the market for a new echo or simply must have video calling/drop-in this is worth the consideration but if you've already covered your home in echos, taps, and dots then you can wait for this to get better or cheaper.Pros:++ Great sounding speakers++ All the Alexa/Echo features you know and love, only better+ Certain skills, e.g. allrecipies, really benefit from the screen+ Amazon features skills enhanced for Echo ShowCons:-- Interface and display isn't customizable-- Display isn't utilized well or at all for some features (e.g. messaging)- Touch interface doesn't run deep- Most expensive EchoThe hardware itself is great, only an OLED screen would offer any marked improvements but the software just has to get better to make more use of  the screen and touch functionality, hopefully with improved interfaces as well.  This is very much an investment in what the future will be for this device and while it's a promising start it's not there just yet.

B01J24C0TI	Inferior Next Gen Product, centered on subscription and service sales.	Not especially impressive. Big money grab, like having constant salesman in my living room, like Apple, Amazon pushes their services and products just a little too far. Where I love the Echo, I must say this seems like an inferior next gen, heavily considering returning. Screen is very small, AI is limited, couldn't get lyrics without subscription plan. Haven't tried face to face call yet, unsure if I need a synched cell, and no one else I know has a "Show".  On the whole, very disappointing.

B01J24C0TI	I bought this echo show for my sister in a nursing home who is paralyzed.	I bought this echo show for my sister in a nursing home who is paralyzed. In a way it is sort of a godsend.  I rated three stars because I want Amazon to improve it. I would like to see its functionality the same as the Amazon fire. I would like my sister to be able to access Facebook,  along with everything else the Amazon fire can do - in the echo show at this point it cannot. It is wonderful that I can check in with my sister several times a day with the video call. What needs to be done is to be able to  make video calls with an Amazon Fire  or an iPad.  Currently the Alexa app only is able to make calls from my cell phone. What needs to be done is to allow the Alexa app to make calls from the Amazon Fire  or any other platform as long as it is connected to the Wi-Fi. Great job Amazon! Please make it better!

B01J24C0TI	Mine's goin' back	I had so hoped for more with this product.  While it looks great, it falls short in three areas that are key for me.First, when the "Show" is sitting on a table, desk, etc., the camera points up to the ceiling.  My prime reason for buying this product was to us "Drop In" to check up on my dog when I'm not there.  The dog is frisky but can't quite get to the ceiling.  I guess I could trade her for a pet fly.  I also wanted to evaluate the product for checking in on my elderly mother who lives alone.  Again, seeing her ceiling doesn't help much.  I can't believe this didn't come up in testingSecond, I experience a huge lag in response.  For example, I'll ask Alexa to put bacon on my shopping list. Almost immediately my list is displayed with bacon on the top.  Maybe 10-15 seconds later Alexa chimes in and say "I've added bacon to your shopping list".  I've seen many such cases where the voice response lags the text significantly.  That is not the case when using the identical commands on my Dot or my Tap.Third, the interface to the Ring doorbell is too slow to be useful, and there is no capability to talk to the person on the front porch. I need to use my iPhone for that.This product has real potential, but to use a bad pun, it is not ready for Prime time.

B01J24C0TI	A lot of promise...	I guess i thought having a screen would allow the device to have some tablet like functionality as well. The touchscreen is there, but you can't install or use it for much of anything.  It is of use occasionally when Alexa gets confused looking for music title for example.  You are given a list of results to scroll through.  Everything is voice driven.  I get it being an echo device, but why can't we use the screen to do anything?There is a lot of potential if we are allowed to install apps.  There is little to choose from.  I believe we should have access to the tablet apps as well as "skills".  It would make the device a bit more than a novelty.  I hope the future will lead to much more practical application of the screen.  It feels like the functionality has been neutered to restrict you to voice only thus eliminating much of the app ecosystem.

B01J24C0TI	Fun, but still learning a lot of techniques to make things work.	Still learning all the do's and don't's, as well as can's and can't's of this device.  Fun to use.  Sometimes it takes a while, but we have almost always been able to get to music and movies that we ask for.  Biggest disappointment is the inability to print directly to our network printer.  There are some strange and convoluted workarounds, but they had serious short comings.  This is one problem I hope gets fixed in the very near future.  Now, if I can only figure out how to access Netflix or my ROKU.

B01J24C0TI	Room to run	I purchased the two pack on the day it was announced, knowing that I'd have over a month to cancel the order if I decided it wasn't worth it. During setup, I did have trouble connecting to my amazon account. There really wasn't much online yet about troubleshooting since it was the release day, but I figured out how to reset the echo and the setup worked fine after that. These things seem to have been linked to my account prior to shipping because both are showing up in the Alexa app, although I've only unboxed one of them so far.After a couple days, my impression is that the echo show has a bright future ahead. The music feature with lyrics is fantastic. I think this is probably going to prove to be a major hit. Alexa on the other hand, although impressive, has tremendous opportunities for refinement and improvement. She recognizes speech pretty consistently, but I find myself forgetting to wait a second or two for her to start listening after saying the wake word, so I end up having to repeat myself. Haven't had a whole lot of time to really explore the device outside of music, occasional questions, and a couple YouTube videos. I do think there's a great deal of potential here for Amazon in the Home IOT space. In a few months, with further development, no doubt this review would be five stars.	Will M.

B01J24C0TI	The best Echo yet, especially if you have elderly parents	This was really worth the wait. I bought the Echo Show for my parents, who are elderly, and have a variety of ailments.  Since they have arthritis, and a few other issues, I didn't want them to go and answer the doorbell, just to find it's someone soliciting them to buy random junk. So, last year, I bought and installed the Ring Doorbell Pro in their house, which works very well.  The Ring Doorbell Pro is hardwired and not battery operated. After the skill was enabled, I could tell Alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up. You really need a good Wi-Fi router with the Echo show as the video will be jerky since the video is very high quality. If you have a good Wi-Fi router, the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth. I thought the doorbell would launch the app on the Echo Show automatically, but it does not. You have to initiate the connection yourself. Hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill. I can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do, but for a very first implementation, it works great with the hardwired version of the Ring Doorbell Pro.The battery powered Ring products do not work as great though. When trying to connect the Echo Show to a battery powered Ring device, I get a message saying something like, " The camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take 30 sec". This happens with my Ring Stickup Camera. So, if you want the best experience, you should buy the Ring Doorbell Pro instead of the battery powered versions.One of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn't have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call.  So, we have another Echo Show, just for her, in drop in mode.  This has really worked very well for us since she does not have to fumble and look for her cell phone if we need to call and check up on her. Also, we use to call her cell phone, but then we would find that the phone was not changed enough, so the call would end prematurely, or the call would not go through.  All of those issues have gone away with the Echo Show.  If she needs to call a family member, that's just a voice call away as well.Right now, she can use her voice to call up movie and TV shows on Amazon Prime.  Hopefully, Netflix, and other services, will also be forth coming.  But for now, the shows on Amazon Video will suffice.  I've outfitted my parents house with Homekit products from Philips Hue, Lutron, and iDevices, and all of them work flawlessly with the Echo Show.One feature that I found by accident, that I have not found documented anywhere, is that if you hold down the mute button for about 3 or 4 seconds, than a user interface comes up that allows you to shut down the device entirely.  A user interface that's says "Power Off" come up.  Then you can either hot OK to power the device off or hit Cancel to go back to the main screen.  We use the timer function a lot for preparing medicine and cooking food.  When I set a timer, the Echo Show actually shows the timer on the screen.  Therefore, I don’t have to ask it how much time is left every so often.  I can actually see how much time is left.  This may sound like a small thing, but it's really very helpful.  You can even dismiss a timer with a swipe instead of saying cancel timer, or stop timer, when the timer goes off.The Echo Show definitely isn't perfect.  Even though the camera works well, I wish it could swivel so that you can fine tune the position of it.  But all in all, for the scenarios my parents use it for, it works great for a first release.  The ability to check in on someone that's bed ridden, and can't move all that well, even to pick up a cell phone, makes this a great device to own.

B01J24C0TI	Good starting point.	As long as Amazon continues to update its software and tells us about it just like they're already doing with the audio-only Echo and Alexa, it's going to be great. A desktop physical device with digital assistant that listens to you without you pressing a button or going into an app first? This is truly consumer-focused product. Yes it's lacking features and not working well 100% of the time, but it will keep getting better.Changed from 5 stars to 4 stars. Would prefer if the speaker had strong bass. I listen music on this all the time.	Amazon Shopper since 1998	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AZRF8RRS2EGEL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	4	2017/07/01
B01J24C0TI	Ya gotta get one right away....these are terrific, I think.	This is the future of whatever the heck these things are. Amazing fidelity from such a small box. Built heavy duty. Do we really have to pay $3.99 per month for each of these devices? I would probably by 5 of these if the subscription terms were better. Is there anywhere on the internet to learn about Alexa? When I ask for a song by name she says it  is not available, then calling up the artist brings up exactly the song I asked for minutes later.  Is there an alarm clock function?These will only get better with time. I feel honored to get my white show so quickly.So many questions.

B01J24C0TI	It's an Echo all the way.  Just doesn't do what I want it to do.	It's OK, although still new to me.  Getting some hang of the video capabilities, but not as useful as I thought it could be.  It is a true Amazon Echo device though,  Easy to set up with the screen assisting for sure.  Doesn't sound quite as good as the original tall Echo and not as loud.I really bought this for my Mother as a replacement Bluetooth speakers used for her TV in hopes we could call each other.  Got it paired with her Bluetooth transmitter from the TV fine.  Works well as a replacement Bluetooth speaker to play her TV through.BUT, when I try to use Alexa's features, such as "play me a song", it starts the song, then flips back to the TV feed from Bluetooth.  Now, I am not an expert in Bluetooth, but I did some tests with my tablet.  When playing  tune from my tablet as a Bluetooth speaker and I ask Alexa to play a song from Prime Music, it sends a shut-down command to my tablet (which stops the audio feed and disconnects from my tablet) and reverts back to internal speakers.  IT NEVER SWITCHES BACK TO MY TABLET AS REMOTE SPEAKERS!!Now, in the case of using it with my Mother's TV Bluetooth speaker, it can't turn off the Bluetooth transmitter, thus the Bluetooth transmitter continues to take control from Alexa doing other tasks.  Hence, calls from remote Alexa devices are disconnected, plays from Prime songs, and probably most anything that requires streaming WILL NOT WORK WITH BLUETOOTH ENABLED.I give it 3 stars because it is a true Alexa doesn't work as I had expected, and I end up with a second Echo Show with nothing to do with it.  I'll re-install her original Bluetooth speaker and bring the Echo Show back home.Didn't like the high angle on the camera anyways.  These things are typically set up to be totally horizontal and require a prop to bring it to vertical because we place these thing son a shelf above our field of vision.Shame it couldn't disconnect and reconnect to Bluetooth on its own.

B01J24C0TI	Happy with purchase!	Just received my Echo Show today.ProsSetup was a breeze. Since I have other Alexa devices in my household, once I put in my WIFI password it just updated the device and I was done.It also connected to my home control system without me having to take any extra steps.I was able to pair it with my ring doorbells and it functioned properly. It's nice being able to say "Alexa show me front door" and it pops up on the screen.I like the design of it and am impressed with the picture quality of the screen. Also I am impressed with the sensitivity of the microphones and how well the pickup my commands while speaking in a regular voice. The sound quality of the speakers are also good. It's not party quality, which it is not designed for, but nice enough to just sit around and listen music in a quite environment. Overall I am very happy with my purchase so far.ConsI REALLY DONT CARE IF KYLIE JENNER APOLOGIZES FOR THE TUPAC SHIRT. I hate the scrolling portion of this device. If I want anything to scroll across the screen, I would like it to be things I choose.

B01J24C0TI	Work in progress.	It's a work in progress. Amazon Echo has a huge opportunity here. The company has successfully integrated itself into thousands of households. But, the company has yet to successfully connect the echo and firestick product line to communicate. The echo ecosystem could make smart homes a reality if everything worked together. For example, I have 4 echo's throughout my home but they don't talk to each other. Why? Why can't I have full surround music play in the entire home? Add two firesticks to boot and Amazon could create a one of a kind experience. Hence, the work in progress sentiment. Stop focusing on skills and develope integrated communication. Make the echo's and firesticks simultaneously communicate with all of my other Smart Home Products. And then we'll be on to something fantastic.

B01J24C0TI	Think about it and do a little research on what it can and cannot do before you buy.	The jury is still out on this one. I like it, but there are a few things I expected it to do and it does not. The simplest thing is weather radar... you would think it could show you that, wouldn't you? Nope... it does not. Will continue working on it to see what I can do with it, Not sure it is worth the money for a screen... I use Facetime for calling people with video so I didn't need it for that and very few people I know have it.

B01J24C0TI	The Echo Show Really Performs!	So far it has been a pretty good experience with the Echo Show. I can get my Prime Music with the lyrics on the screen, almost like karaoke, and a full 7 day weather forecast shows when you ask for a weather report.  The Show offers some helpful suggestions in the form of a live screensaver when not in use. When your presence is not detected for a while, the Show goes to a dimly lit black screen and clock with large numbers you can easily see across the room. The only drawback I have encountered so far is, to my surprise, the Show does not have the full functionality of all of the Skills that the original Alexa and the Echo Dot can perform. For instance, when I asked the Show to tune to the Weather Channel, using the Dish Network Skill, the response was to double check my Alexa App for the Skill, but a few seconds later, I asked the original Alexa to perform the same function and it was handled flawlessly. Keep in mind tho... this is a newly released product and I am sure that functionality will improve over time. I am looking forward to many years of enjoyment with all of my Amazon Alexa, Echo Dot, and Echo Show devices that I have throughout the house! Thanks for reading my review!

B01J24C0TI	Muffled, bassy sound....not a good as the original Echo	Very disappointed in the sound of the Echo Show which is muffled and has too much bass. In addition, the sound level is low on some music and louder on others. Overall, it's not as loud as the original Echo. As others have noted, the text flashing across the screen is annoying. It would be nice to be able to set the screen to always show weather, stocks, photos, etc..instead of the text you are forced to view. When I request a song on YT, it doesn't tell you what it's playing, only that it's playing 'top result from YouTube' and it seems very limited. I am sure in time what you see on screen will be improved but there is nothing that can be done with the poor sound. Overall, I'd say it's better than the Dot and possibly the Tap, but sound wise it's much worse than the Echo and I may be returning it for the sound quality alone. My advice: buy the original Echo if you care about the audio sound of your music.

B01J24C0TI	Amazing new device even for those of us who have Echo already.	I was early adopter of Echo when it first came out and have enjoyed all of its features since.  My son had not gone to Echo so when new Echo Show came out I bought one for each of us.  All I can say is that this is amazing.  I thought I would not find that much difference but the touch screen and all the variety of features that you can see on the screen make this a terrific upgrade.  I have yet to use many of the features but several items worth noting.  First, if you have an existing Echo you can set a different wake word for each device.  Then if playing music at the top you will see where you can choose the device to play.  I did not find that my remote will work with Show but it could be I have not found the setting yet.  I did a number of settings on my computer application before realizing some of the settings I had to do on the Show device itself.  The touch screen is a major plus in this regard.  As for set up it was extremely easy.  So if you have and like your Echo you might want to give Echo Show a try.  I will admit I thought there would not be much of a difference but I was wrong.	pbk63	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1XYJ3UXLWO082/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	5	2017/07/01

B01J24C0TI	Seems Rushed - Needs a lot of Real World Rethinking	Was hopeful I would fall in love with this device. But using it for the last couple of days, I can see it was shipped way too early. The software in the current shipping iteration needs a lot of work.Positives:-  Speakers are louder and more full sounding vs the echo. Still not sonos quality my any means. But I would say about 20% better sound quality vs the current echo.- Video calling works well.- Seeing the multiple named timers on screen is very helpfulNegatives:- The heavily advertised Ring / Nest / Arlo video function is a horrible implementation. It is most likely software related given you have to say "Hey Alexa, view my camera" Then it takes 10-20 seconds to load. I have tested this on all of the different cameras. First it's too slow, but second, the likelihood of using in this context is ridiculous. The video function should send the push notifications from Ring if someone Rings your Door or sees motion. It should just pop up on the screen. Not sure who thought this would be a selling feature vs actual real world usages.- Limited settings - I don't want to get tips on how to use it. I would idieally like the screen to be black when not in use. Currently, it is on all the time when it sees motion and shows you random news and tips on how to use.- Ugly Design - In the pictures you don';t actually see how thick it is. It takes up a decent amount of room and looks like a 90's rear projection TV. Does not looke like something you want in your nice kitchen.- Not adjustable - Given the camera is an important feature you can adjust the angle of the screen. I am tall 6'3" and I have to squat down given my whole head gets cut off. Also if you have lights behind you the camera does not focus.Hopefully, most of these features can be fixed via software updates. Otherise I would stick with an echo or dot for now.	R.

B01J24C0TI	Good device, but not quite there.	I own the original echo, an echo dot, and now the show.  While I am enjoying the Show for the novelty of what it is, I am not convinced we are ready for a smart assistant with a screen.  Most of the skills that work with the screen are kitchy and the rest could be done with any of the echos.  The sound is on par with the Echo and the screen is crisp.  You CAN dim the screen by going into the settings, not something that is apparent by just using the device and I have seen quite a few people complain that cannot dim.  I believe it has a built in screen protector that removes the "news" cards that repeat, but I am not sure how it works.  I've had it go to the screen once while playing music and then again when I woke up and came into the living room, I can't even find an option to set a timer.One of the biggest reasons I gave it 3 stars is that Amazon does not include this device in their amazon unlimited music echo subscription.  To those not familiar with that it is a $3.99 version that allows you to stream albums that are stuck behind a paywall.  The echo, dot, tap are all included, but not the show.  This means if you want to listen to new music you will be forced to pay $7.99.All in all it is a great device for the person who wants to have the new "tech toy", but I would wait until it establishes itself more and have more options that relates to the use you want to get out of it.

B01J24C0TI	Great potential...needs some work.	I received this item on the release date and I haven't been as excited about any product since the original Echo. Upon plugging this in, I encountered my first disappointment...unable to log in to my Amazon account. On-screen instructions asked me to visit the Amazon help forum but I didn't find any answers there. I tried rebooting and this time around, it says I can't log in because an account already exists. After second reboot, it finally started up and asked to update software. Okay, I guess they haven't worked out all the kinks before pushing this out the door. I'm fine with that.Next, I had some trouble having the Echo Show communicate with my smart home devices. That was eventually resolved when I plugged my old Echo back in. Maybe somehow it needs to communicate through a "primary" device? Anyway, on to the features. The thing I was most excited about was being able to see my camera feeds. This worked ok but there was quite a bit of lag between giving the command and camera feed showing up on the screen. Not so useful if someone rings the doorbell and having to wait 20s before I can see who's there. Then I tried video streaming via YouTube and Amazon. Yes, this works but I'm not going to stand there and watch a full video on this tiny screen. Appears to be more a novelty feature than something actually useful. Also, I'm not a fan of the interface because whenever you stop a video or stop playing music, it doesn't know to go back to the main screen. You have to tell Alexa to go back to home screen. Speaking of the home screen, I can't stand the Alexa help tips that keep popping up. I would hope that they put in an option to turn it off. One feature that I do like is using the Echo Show as a digital picture frame. The disappointing part is that you can only upload 1 photo. I'm sure this can be fixed with a future software update.I want to talk about the camera now. Video calling was supposed to be the killer feature of this device and I want to say Amazon failed miserably here. The biggest problem, also mentioned in other reviews, is the camera angle. It is not adjustable so it's always pointing up to the ceiling. You can't really video chat unless you're close to the device or if you place the device on the floor. This is something that can't be fixed with software and we may just need to wait until the next iteration of the device. Not to mention, the software for calling isn't polished either and it's extremely buggy. Drop-in would only work 50% of the time and calls are successful maybe 30% of the time.Overall, I think the Echo Show has potential but needs some improvements. It does everything the original Echo does so I don't consider it a worse product. I see it as a device that will get better over time and worth the extra $50 if you were considering an Echo device anyway. Speakers are comparable and build quality is good. Although the Echo Show did not live up to my expectations, I would still recommend this product.

B01J24C0TI	The future: we're not there yet.	I use Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant fairly often in different settings, and I'm left wondering if perhaps the bar in my head is set a bit too high for Alexa.Can she lock my front door? Yes. But remembering the specific skill command is a bit unnatural. Instead of "Alexa, lock the front door," it's "Alexa, tell Smartlink to lock the front door." And there's no concept of "Alexa, tell Smartlink to lock all doors." Nevermind the fact that neither the locks nor the system they're connected to are called "Smartlink". Similarly, you can't say "Alexa, set the temperature to 72." With a Nest thermostat, you have to tell her the name of the thermostat. Minor, minor things, I get it. But they seriously crimp your "I live in the world of tomorrow" style when you can't just say "Lock the front door." or "Set the temperature to 72."Can she answer questions? Yes, if you ask her the right way. Even then, she doesn't understand context like the other assistants. So, when I asked "How old was John Lennon when he was shot?" Alexa told me that there's a new patch that can be applied at home as an alternative to flu shots.I rephrased. "Alexa, how old was John Lennon when he died?" which got her to start spouting off a synopsis from the Wikipedia article, where she eventually got to the question I asked. The other assistants tell you that he was 40.It's cool, but in a nerdy "this is probably more effort than it's worth" kind of way.Getting past Alexa and to the Echo Show hardware, there are some nice aspects. The screen is reasonably clear for the price, and the sound quality is decent. The design has a cool look to it, but in more of an 80's futurist aesthetic. That's about where it ends, though.Right off the bat, not being able to completely dim the display is a really, really dumb design choice. You can set the Echo Show to go into sleep mode through the Alexa app, and that will make the screen go to black with a white clock, but it's still rather bright. If you need darkness to sleep, you're not going to want this in your bedroom. Speaking of dumb design choices, it's even dumber that you can't just tell Alexa to go to sleep. (The command Alexa expects is "Alexa, do not disturb.") Update: This *can* be accomplished through setting up a DND schedule in the Alexa app on your phone, and then by turning the clock off through a series of screen taps through the Settings menu -- on your device that's supposed to be controlled by voice.)When the Echo Show isn't in DND mode, the attraction screen constantly scrolls through a bunch of junk, with little to no context. It gives as much precedence to what I've put on my calendar as it does to inviting people to ask how tall Mount Everest is, or that Jay-Z has a new album. I'd understand if I'd ever expressed interest in Mount Everest, or if I had ever purchased a Jay-Z album from Amazon. But it's just random. Right now, the one I put in the kitchen is showing me pictures of a starry night, and it's 10 a.m. Thanks?Watching content on the Echo Show works, and I guess if you wanted a media consumption device somewhere between your phone and computer, it makes sense. Maybe in a kid's room? I dunno. It's one of those things that you *can* do, but I have a hard time envisioning many times when you would want to. In the kitchen, if you could do "Alexa, show me how to filet a fish" and have a video pop up that showed you how, that would be great. That's actually what I was expecting. Instead, she says "Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question."The drop-in function is super interesting, but even that can get infuriating."Alexa, drop in on my other Echo Show""Which contact or device do you want to drop in on?""Bedroom" (My devices are named "Kitchen" and "Bedroom")"I don't see that contact.""Alexa, show me my devices.""For instructions on how to control your home, look at the Help page in your Alexa app.""Alexa, what devices do I have?""For instructions on how to control your home, look at the Help page in your Alexa app."Great. My Echo Show won't show me its own help documentation -- not that I wanted to read it in the first place.So, what you wind up with is this amalgam of different products, where the Echo Show can do all sorts of stuff, but none of it very well. At this point, I'm starting to wonder how long it'll take for the Echo Show to be little more than a glorified picture frame in everyday use. On the bright side, you're going to see at least two in Warehouse Deals soon.

B01J24C0TI	Echo Show Debut Disappoints And Comes Up Short	Ordered two Echo Show devices. Disappointed with the engineer's software that does not allow one to cancel the video during setup. But that is minor compared to the perpetual display of skill categories and "Try" examples which can not be turned off except to limit the display from continuous to static. Contacted Customer Service who admitted the product was so new he did not know if there was a fix. He referred me to technical support, and that individual, meaning well, was equally unsure except to assure me that a software fix would be forthcoming and he would convey my experience. He also assured me that the perpetual display rotation of categories and Try suggestions would terminate after 30 minutes. Left both devices "on" over night, and the software behavior displayed the same after several hours. Also, in the quick setup, directions state the unit turns itself on when walking into the room or upon hearing "Alexa", which in my experience never occurred. I read the manual provided in the Echo App, the quick start guide and scrolled through the settings available when swiping down from the top of the display screen and none of the settings allowed one to stop the display of categories and Try suggestions except to make the display stop progressing hence a static category and Try suggestion. Or one can turn the display off along with mic/camera. Apparently based on reviews for this product, many purchasers find the Echo Show acceptable or excellent. I never argue with perception. The software is amateurish and the interface is unacceptable. Once I determined how limited the settings were designed to be, I arranged to return both devices. I would have loved to reach a different conclusion but the Echo Group designed in my opinion an expensive device that does what the Echo does but with a screen and a most annoying interface. Not what I expected or would accept. For those who are enjoying their Show, I am happy for them.

So far it does everything my original echo does but rating it at 1 star because my main reason for the purchase was the ring doorbell skill which is a complete flop. The ads of the integration where misleading. I expected to be able to get notifications of a doorbell press and be able to see who was at the door without having to look for my phone. All I can do is bring up a live view if I'm lucky most of the time it just shows that it buffering. It's one of those things that Amazon would probably blame ring and if I contact ring they will blame Amazon so I'm just gonna have to sit here and wait for the skill to develop over time till then 1 star	slpbird	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A3GXPQFY2OSY0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	1	2017/07/01

B01J24C0TI	Echo Show - Great concept but I would not recommend purchasing this right now.	Being an early adopter I was curious about the Echo Show and bought one for my kitchen counter. After using it for a couple of days I think there are both pro's and con's for this product.Pro- great concept. I can see that this is going to be very useful down the road.- Clean somewhat retro design. Blends in without much fanfare.Con- not very useful right now. Most of the skills were designed for voice, not voice and video. I suspect this will change but at this moment it makes for a clunkier interface.- While the design is retro I think that it could have been optimized for use either in a kitchen or study.- Speakers cannot handle bass at anything greater than volume set at mid levels.ConclusionThis could end up being a great product but its not ready for prime time yet. Given its price tag ($50 more than the Echo) I would hold off on purchasing this for at least a couple of months till the skills are video ready.DisclaimerI am a tech geek and I use Alex for home automation. I currently own one Echo Dot and one Echo in addition to the Echo Show I just purchased.

B01J24C0TI	Love the Echo Show	This should be rated on what it can do vs. what it can't do.  So now I can cook dinner watching a movie from Amazon Prime or listening to a song while viewing the lyrics (which is so awesome) or finding a recipe, all while using the same functionality as the tall Echo like turning on my lights or asking for a measurement conversion. The white looks nice in a kitchen.  The speakers are excellent.  Of course it is a luxury purchase, but it makes life a little more fun.  Very cool.

B01J24C0TI	What a Big Disappointment	Got my 2 Echo Shows wed. Bought the pair 2save $100, was hesitate 2buy 2of something So New, but me being a gadget guy, I bought the Alexia Echo day1, I have 2 echo dots, fire stick, the tap, and I think I've bought 5Kindles 4 me and Grandkids. One died within a yr, it took almost a yr 2get A replacement 4 a $60 KINDLE, THE principal. Now I've got these 2Shows, Now Nothing from Amazon comes w a Good set of Instructions, just a quick start guide so later u buy the books from them. I did quick setup n find they need Access 2All my Cell Contacts in my phone, WHY? CAN'T I JUST PUT IN MY FAMILY NUMBERS, THE 1S I WILL B CALLING. NOT MY 350 OTHER Contacts thru work, my Doc n Dentist. I go 2play a Beatles song, after 10 min of buffering after a line of Song I stopped it, tried other song, same thing, NO Speed, my Alexia plays songs everyday 4me w/o issue. Then the BIG KICKER COMES, my Whole house is Setup w Z-WAVE DEVICES With a SMARTING HUB. I CONTROL MY LIGHTS, MOTION, WINDOWS OPEN, Honeywell THERMOSTAT, I have WEMO PLUGS, TP PLUGS, Different Light blubs, all controlled by Smartt hinges tied 2 my Alexia Echo. In Description it said control all the home Security devices, 2day I find it DOES NOT WORK WITH SMARTING HUB, only a few Amazon lists. I read everything I could about these Echo Shows b4 I pre-ordered, not much info 2read but I tried 2do my homework first. These devices r right direction, but Released Way 2Early with all these bugs n non compatible w z-Wave, Which is becoming a Standard. I asked Many ?? BUT SIMPLE THINGS LIKE DISTANCE 2Sun from Earth, Couldn't answer (93mill miles, 5thGrade) Earth 2Moon, no answer, couldn't play a Beatles song. I'm giving it a few more days once I but another cell with only Family contacts put in. Then I will probably send them back because they don't do what they say they do in INFORMATION ON AMAZON. I hope others have Good luck with it, but I see now 2me they are just another echo dot w a screen. One positive thing, I did buy a RING SPOTLIGHT 4 REARYARD, this will work with it and Ring doorbells, but not the 2DVRs or the 16 security cameras I got on amazon 4my house n yard. Save ur Money, wait a yr 4bugs 2b worked out, then try, maybe by then they will be out of BETA MODE.

B01J24C0TI	Meh	Sound quality to me was a disappointment in comparison to our Echo.  We also had issues with ours not picking up our commands based on where we were standing in the room, which was never an issue with our old echo.  The screen is also very glossy, which makes it difficult to see in a sunny room, and shows fingerprints very easily.  It also is very awkwardly shaped and seems more intrusive in my kitchen than the echo.I feel like in a few years, once there our more apps that make use of the screen, this product will be a good deal.  At the moment however, don't waste your money and just get an echo when they are on sale. We our sadly returning ours and plugging back in our trusty echo.	brokenglish	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A8MQVP0KUHMG3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	3	2017/06/30

B01J24C0TI	WARNING!  Calling and Messaging can ONLY be setup on your newer phones!	I just completed a chat session trying to setup the Echo calling and messaging.  BUYERS BE FOREWARN!For this feature to work, you MUST HAVE either an Android phone or iphone.  And it must not be an older version of Android OS or iphone (Windows phone will not work).  The ONLY way to setup the calling and messaging feature is to install the Alexa App on the compatible version of Android phone, or iphone.  If you have an older version phones, you're screwed.  There is currently no other way to setup the calling and messaging.- You cannot set this up using Alexa App on tablets- You cannot set this up on Windows--> you can ONLY set this up on compatible Android / iphones.What this means is, if you simply want to do Echo to Echo calling, you're screwed.  Echo to Echo / Drop In calling cannot be setup unless you install the Alexa App on a compatible Android phone or iphone.  I'm sure they work once you are able to set it up; but that's the problem...you will not be able to set it up unless you have a newer phone (which I do not have).I hope I made my point clear enough; because this was not listed as a requirement in their promos.  I pre-ordered two of these based on their video promo, and was very excited when I received them.  Now, I am very disappointed.

B01J24C0TI	Day 1 review: I liked my Echo. I like my Echo Show even more.	Day 3: Alexa gets stupid or loses functions?Since I made a point of noting the ability to browse Pandora channels in my Day 1 review, I have to note that, two days later, this function has  suddenly disappeared. Now "Alexa, show me my channels on Pandora" gets the response "Sorry, this isn't supported on this device." Drop the word "me" and say "Alexa, show my channels on Pandora" yields "What do you want to hear?".---------------Day 1: First day with the echo show.  I'm pretty pleased with it.  Some observations that I think have not been hit in most reviews:* Sound quality seems similar to that of the Echo cylinder.  Good for a desktop listening experience, not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound.* The Show does have an ambient light sensor (using the camera?) so that the screen dims as the room lighting goes down. When I darkened the room at night to work at my PC, the Show display dimmed to the point where I could just make out the time, and not the background photo at all.* Much has been made of the Show displaying lyrics when playing Prime music.  That doesn't appeal to me, but when playing music from Spotify, Pandora, and My Music on Amazon, the Show displays the song title, artist name, album art, and a progress indicator.  That's really nice when listening to playlists - I was always asking my Echo cylinder "Alexa, what's that song?"* Alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my Pandora channels. With the show, if Alexa doesn't recognize the name, I can ask it to display my Pandora channels and select them from the Show touch screen, It's good to have a fallback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the Alexa app, then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection.* Some newsfeeds are now accompanied by appropriate photographs.* You can set the Show to use an album from Amazon Prime Photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive.  AFAIK, other photo servers cannot be used.	Sandbagger	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AR86992NOVBQX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	10	4	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Very Disappointing Sound, Am Returning.	I'm long time fan of Amazon and have four Echo's.  The Echo's sound quality is remarkably good for their size.  We've had the Show for three days and both I and my wife say it sounds like an AM radio.  We've compared the same music on the Echo and the Show and the Echo is much richer, cleaner and seems to have a greater dynamic range.  I've been involved in music my entire life, have played all the brass instruments and listen to music continually.  This is a great idea and when they incorporate better speakers, amps, etc. into a Show format, will probably buy again.Probably should have know since the unit is actually smaller than the Echo and still has to incorporate a video screen and related processing chips.

B01J24C0TI	I love my Echo Dots and Echo	My situation is a little different, perhaps. I love my Echo Dots and Echo, and added this mostly because I wanted a visual station to connect my Smart home devices to other than my phone. I LOVE IT. I have 6 Arlo and 3 Nest cameras that hooked up fairly easily and work seamlessly. "Alexa show driveway" or "Alexa, show front door" is awesome when I'm in the kitchen and want to know was that just the UPS man dropping off my Prime Pantry order, or 5-0 trying to serve that outstanding warrant. Seeing the radar instead of just getting the weather report is awesome, and the sound quality is excellent, better than my Echo.My only complaint is the screen size. I'd have paid more for a screen that I could see further than 6 feet away.	ebtagg	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2M95DPAB5EW3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/06/30

B01J24C0TI	Great All-around Addition to the Household	I got my Echo Show today and have tested it for a few hours now. I'm pretty surprised with negative reviews and I think people haven't tested the device completely. So far I have been very happy with audio, audio and touchscreen quality.Overall the LCD is very useful only if you find Alexa useful too. Echo show is not gonna replace your TV or anything, but I personally prefer to watch flash briefings instead of just listening to them or watch a trending(viral) video on YouTube or watch tonight show monologue in the morning.You can set your Prime photos as your rotating background which is essentially the same as a photo frame.I like to watch TV shows on my mini tablet and the whole Echo show with Alexa compatibility is just cheaper than my tablet with the same size. For example, you can watch TV shows like 24 from Prime Video.Almost none of these functionalities are new or innovative but combining them together for a relativity cheap price has made this product very amusing.Obviously there are some room for improvements which I'm sure with software updates and app developments, we'll see them in the future. I'll probably update this post later.	Ryan N.	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2AU1N4W0HQFFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	10	5	2017/06/30

The star off is because you cannot sign into your netflix or youtube accounts -- so even though I am a "RED" subscriber, and a netflix subscriber too, I cannot use this device to bring up videos from youtube without the annoying ads -- maybe I will have to buy a google version of this when they follow amazon a year later as usual.

B01J24C0TI	Muddy voice quality, poor audio, and terrible software - not the Amazon quality we've come to expect	I have several generations of Kindle Fire tablets, and both the Echo and Echo Dot, all of which which have proven to be impressive devices. The Echo in particular has proven to be very useful for controlling Smart Home devices such as the TP Link smart switches. All of these devices have excellent audio quality for their size. From that experience I was expecting the Echo Show to be of similar quality, and the initial impression in unpacking its well crafted shipping box seemed destined to bear that out. Unfortunately, I did not find it to live up to expectations for reasons I will outline.In powering up the Show, I was immediately impressed by screen quality and the ease of the setup process. As an initial test I simply asked for weather, which produced a very nice display. The Show also responded well to voice command, so it looked certain to be the equivalent of an Echo enhanced by a display.I have a Ring doorbell, a Smart Home device that requires a video display, which was a motivator for acquiring the Show. As advertised the Show displayed what my Ring doorbell sees, but that's the extent of what it could do (e.g., the Show couldn't answer the doorbell, or talk to whoever was there, something that still required my smart phone, so why bother). I would lay that obvious inadequacy at Ring's feet, but none the less a disappointment.Shrugging the Ring experience off, I next tried stuff that's purely Amazon's, starting with Kindle books. The Show listed my Kindle library as a row of book covers, but a recent purchase was omitted for some reason. What I immediately discovered is that you can't actually read a book on the Show. If you have the audio version, the Show will read it to you, but doesn't display the companion text (which is a feature on the Fire). Worse, the sound quality is awful, being muddy and echoey, making it hard to understand the narration. In an independent reaction, my wife asked why the voice was so muddy, a description I soon recognized applies to the Alexa voice as well.Since voice and music are two different audio animals, I next asked the Show for my music library. Let me say here that the music software is simply bizarre. If you select an album it grabs one of the songs and that's the only one you can play. If you return to the home screen and ask for your music again, then select the same album, it comes up with a different song to be played. There is no way to access the contents of an album. What the heck? While the display is pretty, it is almost useless. Worse yet, in playing something demanding for an audio system (a movement it grabbed from my Vivaldi Four Seasons album), the results were screechy and unbalanced, close to unlistenable; i.e., it would appear that the unintelligible book audio and Alexa's muddy voice are symptomatic of a generally poor audio system.I had really wanted to like the Show, but it simply is not what it purports to be. It looks good, and feels solid, but it's what's inside that counts.  The Show falls well short on both software and sound quality. I will credit the unit for having an excellent display and easy set up, but as for the rest, ugh.  I initially thought I would wait for software upgrades to fix things, but I don't think there's anything that can be done to correct the audio deficiencies. I'm sending it back.	C.

B01J24C0TI	Half-Baked release -- especially with RING DOORBELL integration	I was very excited about having the opportunity to own the new Amazon Echo Show. I bought two of them.While the build quality is very good, it's the lack of "completeness" that makes this device as great as it could be.For starters, let's begin at the home screen.  Throughout the day you are barraged with calendar reminders, weather and timer events.  All of that is good. However, then Alexa tacks on all these "tips" for you to try which just clog up the screen.What Amazon should have done is allow you to make your own personal news feed based on news sources.  These could display throughout the day instead of having Echo advertisements pop up.Next, security cameras.  While Alexa does a good job of tapping into my Nest security cameras, it's the RING DOORBELL that gives me the most frustration.  While it will show my front door on command (with a good few seconds of delay to bring up the video), there is no way to communicate with the person at the door.  How this kind of omission was made between RING and AMAZON is astounding.  This is a major drawback to having RING compatibility.Another problem is making video phone calls.  One must have a cell phone in order to be eligible to make video phone calls.  This makes absolutely no sense.  My mother is elderly, has no cell phone, but has this cool Amazon Echo which is an internet device with camera and she can't make a phone all to another Echo device?  How is something like that possible?The Echo Show also has a habit of slowing down.  That's right, there have been many times where the device starts to lag.  I would ask Alexa a question or give.a command and there would be a 5-10 second delayed response.  Sometimes, Alexa will just time out and not answer at all.It really looks as if this product was rushed out to market with some serious compromises made.  When it works, it works mostly well.  I love the fact I can tell Alexa to show me any camera in my home upon command.  I also enjoy playing Jeopardy with on-screen graphics.Perhaps I am being too harsh on a product that is still basically new, but I thought it fair to let prospective buyers know what kind of issues they are in for.

B01J24C0TI	Promising but SLOW	The new Echo Show joined our household in the kitchen replacing the original Echo and supplementing an Echo Dot. The Show is a promising device, and will serve as a center of quick information in the center for the family. For example, we have started displaying the family calendar for quick reference, and the kids (9 and 12) enjoy listening to music while seeing the lyrics on the display. My son is also using the Show to watch some videos in the kitchen instead of retrieving away. We also like to use the Show to display recipes.We found the Alexa very slow compared to the Dot and Original connected to the same Wi-Fi network so we can only assume the slow response is due to the device and not the network. When we ask Alexa to take an action, there is a good time of silence before Alexa responds. There is also a break between each songs - a much longer duration than we have seen with the Dot or the original. The kids calls this Alexa the Stupid one... We hope this will be fixed with a software upgrade very soon.	NDM	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A3TSP553YWDQNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	3	2017/06/30

B01J24C0TI	I like it!	I already have one original "Tube" Echo and 3 Echo Dots. This new Echo Show is an excellent upgrade to the original Echo. It does everything the original Alexa does plus more.The video call feature works pretty much as good as FaceTime or Skype. The video quality is actually very good. On the original Alexa, you would ask something and sometimes it refers you to the Alexa app for more information. On this, you don't need to do that. The information simply pops up on the screen.I was also able to bring up any Prime movie on Amazon as well as trailers for just about any movie. Song lyrics display on the screen when playing music. I really like how it integrates with my other systems. I can bring up any of my Ring Doorbell and Nest camera feeds. One thing that struck me the most was the sound quality. It can fill the room easily. It's better than the original "tube" echo. Amazon did a great job improving the speaker quality.I don't know why it's getting bad marks for how it looks. It's not really all that bad. Kind of a retro/futureistic design mix. It's also a little smaller than I thought as well. Worth the money?  I would say yes but that's just me. Definitely a step up from the other Echo devices.I only gave it 4 stars for now because of the lack of a few features and the fact that it's still in its infancy so there is much room for improvement over the coming months. Overall though, a great start. Can't wait to see what the developers come up with.

B01J24C0TI	Great device! Where's Netflix?!	A short review of the Amazon Echo Show. I gave this 4/5 stars, because my first big complaint has not been addressed yet. I assume Amazon will be upgrading to other video streaming services soon. Until then, four stars Amazon!VIDEO: no Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc.  only videos available are Amazon Prime. naturally, for us Netflix watchers, this totally sucks. I assume they will get this fix? Amazon? Are you listening? I'm sure your artificial intelligence is doing something over there.MUSIC: Pandora and Spotify are still available, as well as, Amazon music, and the others you would expect from a regular Echo.INTERCOM: this is probably the coolest part. Calling my kitchen from my bedroom and elsewhere in the house is easy and fast. I labeled my devices: kitchen, bedroom, etc. just ask Alexa to call whichever device. I have a big house, so this is very helpful. I'm also in a wheelchair, so when I'm stuck in bed, calling my caregiver in the other room is highly beneficial.DISPLAY:The echo show is also pretty fun as the screen constantly displays tidbits of information and news and, of course… Ads.  the display will also show your Amazon picture library and you can change the background picture to whatever you like. you also get weather, time, date, etc. it's quite convenient.There's a lot of work to be done for this to be better. The speech recognition is just like the other Echo devices, competent. The sound is actually not that bad, better than the Echo and Dot.  I don't know the Tap.all in all, the device is fun. Actually, all of the echo devices are helpful AND fun. :-)	J. P. Baldwin	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A3KWVKFI3WB44P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	8	4	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Yeehaw	I waited two days to set up Show to give myself a reward for working. I read the majority of the reviews already posted. I have no idea why there is even a one-star review.Setup was a breeze. My Ring Pro screen pops up brilliantly. Nest cameras, too. Played Adele at the maximum volume and sang along with the lyrics Show trickled on the screen.As far as those who boo hoo over the headlines Show displays, you can give her the voice command of DND. Problem solved. Then, just tell her to wake up.I followed the simple instructions on how to change the generic photo on Show's home screen. Easy peasy.Granted, I haven't made a video call yet. Waiting for my folks to get in the game and buy Show.I'm not a lover of all things Amazon. I bought the newest Fire Tablet but returned it after a week. Show redeemed Amazon.If yours isn't working, you either got a dud or you're not doing something right.	kas9103	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A399DZD1RT19ZJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	30	5	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Don't hesitate	I was so on the fence about this, but absolutely love it.  Buy 2, with the package deal, it's so fun to use as a video intercom.  You can "call" or "drop in" so I have one upstairs and one in the family room.  I love "dropping in" on the kids to check on them or remind them about something without having to yell.  And they love being able to get me without running up the stairs.  I can also check on my Nest cameras - so can now see the front door while I'm blow drying my hair.  Love it!

B01J24C0TI	An excellent, well-made device that takes Alexa to the next level. How did I ever live without her??	This latest Echo device from Amazon is a step forward in several ways, and it's packaged and made as nicely as anything from Apple, I might add. So first, the speakers are a big upgrade in sound quality from the original Echo. You can really enjoy music at a decent volume with this device. I stream music from all over the world (for free) thanks to Alexa. The step up is a piece of cake and takes just a few minutes, with very helpful on screen prompts. The screen is fairly small, but the resolution is excellent, so I can see myself watching some shows on this while I cook, etc. Other than that, it functions just as well as the original Echo, but now with great sound and video.

B01J24C0TI	Problem with Alexa Message notification on Echo Show	On the Echo Show, the receipt of an Alexa message is briefly noted on the screen when the message arrived, then disappears. If you don't happen to see the notice when it first shows up, you will not know that you have a message waiting to be played. This is in contrast to the notification light on the Echo and Echo Dot, which continues to flash until the message is retrieved.

B01J24C0TI	Disappointing	We have two Echo's and two Dot's in the house already and like them so we thought we'd try a pair of these. They work fine but don't really do anything very useful with the screen. I'm not going to watch videos on a 7" screen when I have a 65" screen in the room and the constant ads - um, "suggestions," are annoying. Everytime I use it I have to follow up with "Alexa, turn off screen," to get rid of the useless slideshow. The design is OK but it really looks like a scale model of a 2002 Mitsubishi projection TV I once had. We've only had them for a day but my wife, who's an avid fan of Alexa, isn't thrilled with it either so they're probably going back after the weekend.

B01J24C0TI	Issue setting up Echo Show messaging and calling for Aunt who does not have a mobile phone	i planned to configure this for my Aunt and use Echo Show to Echo Show messaging and video calls. The problem is that although she has an Amazon account, she only has a home phone, not a mobile phone which is currently required by Amazon to setup Echo Show to Echo  Show calls. This was confirmed by Amazon Alexa Tech Support.Also can only show one Nest camera at a time vers s the 4 at a time on IOS Nest camera appI can't use my own smartphone to configure her system as it says the phone number is tied to another account	faengelm	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A38A8OZRSUJW3Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	2	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Impressed	So far so good. It is simple and straight forward to set up and has features I like, I will be able to say more when I have used it more. I thinkit is an improvement over the original echo, although I still use it as well, in a different room. It is fun and well laid out.	Edward J.

B01J24C0TI	Exceeds my expectations	Many professional reviewers have come up a little short on this unit indicating it's not enough of this or too much of that. However, I don't see any of the indicated shortcomings as real. I think this is terrific, a great improvement over the tubular Echo. The display in combination with the Echo technology really brings it to another level of usefulness  Very excited to see what skills/apps will take advantage of this device moving forward. The Echo Show has raised the bar.	PCoop	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2O523HQ7TXOF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	11	5	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Good unit overall	I bought 6 of these things. I have a pretty big house and some sort of Alexa device in all my rooms.First- This thing sounds noticeably better then the standard echo. I ended up buying "Amazon Music unlimited" because I like the ability to play specific songs and to my surprise, there is a phone app that lets you use it on your mobile.I also really like the drop in feature. I used it so far to communicate from one room to another. If you have a 2 story house, you will quickly appreciate this feature.There are some weird app things that I wish were different. Example- I have a ring doorbell and the Show will not notify you someone is at the door. You have to either listen for the doorbell or have your phone with you to see the alert. Once you get the alert, you have to then dial in. Another werid thing is that if you want to see your front door bell and there is nothing there; it will say "your doorbell is asleep, please wait 30 seconds and try again". Wished they would just let you see loading and not have to repeat the command in 30 seconds.Also would be nice if the display would show Nest temps on standby. I have 2 nests and still have to use my phone to see the temp.Still giving it 4 stars since my only issues with this unit are software based and Im certain Amazon will update these units quickly. The hardware is great and so far I am happy.	Juan Garcia	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2KIGSZJ802YQ9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	4	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	which is nice, but in the kitchen the ability to control ...	I was so excited to get this, only to discover they aren't maximizing the potential of the screen. When bringing up recipes, it won't stay on the screen for you to refer back to as you work through the recipe. Instead you have to have it sent to your phone which is no longer hands free.  I also linked it to my google calendar in hopes of being able to display daily, weekly or monthly views. No such luck. It only offers a daily view and you have to scroll down to see future dates.  The screen is a touch screen, which is nice, but in the kitchen the ability to control the display with voice commands would be of value. I bought two and returned one, because I can't justify the additional cost over the original echo. I'm sure if you're going to use the show for video calls and dropping in on fellow echo users it would be of more value to you.

B01J24C0TI	May not be able to set up for elderly person	I bought this to video call my 88 year old mother.  A couple things:In order to video call each person needs a separate Amazon account.Also each person has to have a separate smart phone.  You cannot sign in out/on with the Alexa app on one phone to set up both devices, it has to be a separate phone.  It has to be a smart phone too, can't use IPad etc.  If my Mom could facetime I wouldn't need the ECHO Show for video communication,In order to work both persons need:SEPARATE AMAZON ACCOUNTSandEACH PERSON NEEDS A SEPARATE SMART PHONEThis is not stated anywhere in the description.

B01J24C0TI	Great Machine, and It is Only the Beginning!	Got my Show and I love it. There are still many things I need to learn, but having pictures with the reply is very useful. If I ask for information on an historical figure, I can see images of that person, too. I already use my Echo to play my music and listen to books, and having the visual is nice. Many of the present functions are not killer, but give me time to learn, and give Echo Show time to learn too. One app that launched about the same time is Drop In. I don't know that many people with an Alexa, but...let's say my grandson is in his bedroom doing who know's what. When dinner is ready, instead of his mom yelling "[Insert grandson's name here.], dinner is ready." She simply says "Alexa, drop in on [Insert grandson's name here.], Alexa confirms, the green light comes on, and grandson is politely instructed to come to dinner.Brilliant, and maybe a little creepy. I'm not sure I want people outside my household dropping in unannounced, so I currently have Drop In set for family only.So, back to Alexa Show. I play music, and for many songs I get the lyrics. I can access my calendar, and with the touchscreen delete entries. I get visuals with the weather, and I'm a graphic kind of guy. It makes more sense when I'm looking at a chart. At night, it displays the time, so I don't have to ask Alexa what time it is in the middle of the night.Annoying, yesterday was a friend's birthday. It is on my calendar. All day and all night Alexa Show reminded me in a graphic that it was his birthday.Kind of negative: Don't try and watch a movie. The screen was just not made for that.Show is a well-built piece of equipment, easy to install and easy to use. The speaker is adequate but not as good as the speakers on the original Alexa Echo.Hey, we're in the 21st Century. Automated cars, phones that are computers in our pockets, and a visual, audible home computer/companion.Wait, as Show rolls out, the possibilities are near on to endless. Highly recommended.

B01J24C0TI	The Sony Dash Called...It Wants Its Form Factor Back	I am all about Amazon. I love our Alexas--we have 2 standard Echos and 3 dots stationed throughout the house. The Echo Show really added nothing to our experience. Its speaker is not as good as the standard Echo. It also only pulls up recipes from Recipes.com (and only in a limited way), so I am much better off just propping up my Kindle Fire in the kitchen and not limiting myself. We got it to play a few Youtube videos. Again, it was hit and miss during a search. Really just a novelty, and I would not opt for this over a conventional Echo, even if I didn't own any. This may be good for someone who wants a baby monitor or an expensive pet camera or ability to check on someone (albeit in a limited area), but even then, I think there are better, less expensive options.The screen is good quality, and set-up is a breeze, but at this price point, the form factor is sorely lacking. My years-old Sony Dash, which I still use as an alarm clock  and video player has more personality. This is what the Dash would have liked to have been five years ago, not what the Echo should want to be today. Which industrial design company is responsible for this retro (and not-in-a-good-way) design? It's also a fingerprint magnet.I want Amazon to continue to be successful in this area. The Echo gains new functionality daily and has become an everyday tool in my family's lives. The addition of reminders is a game-changer. The next iteration of Echo should essentially be a Kindle with always-on voice recognition and the ability to "face-time" with other people who have the Alexa app. The Show, at this stage of the game, is an epic fail. It's not that it's bad, but that the other Echos are cheaper, better, and can even be made wireless with third party add-ons. For the price, you can buy several dots or two standard Echos and a new Kindle Fire. I wish it were more than it is. I await the next, hopefully great, upgrade.	T.C.

B01J24C0TI	Love it! Things to try need to go	Love the entire echo family and this one is an amazing addition. Its like the rest but with video and great quality too! Only complaint is I can't get rid of the things to try screen, kinda annoying.

B01J24C0TI	Amazing device...Amazon is becoming the next Apple	I own many Amazon products such as the dot, wand, echo and now the echo show.  I tested it out quite a bit last night including calling from a cell phone via the app to the echo.  It is fantastic.  It was hands down better than Apple Facetime that I normally would utilize with a friend via WiFi on our iPads.  This was much more smooth and I didn't get any dropped connection.  The audio from this thing is incredible, it sounded like my friend was in the room, crystal clear.  When it comes to how loud the echo show can get....woooo, it can blast like no other, very clear and loud.  When it comes to getting the weather, it was so nice to see the extended weather forecast on the screen.  You can also customize it to show your own favorite wallpaper.  I can't recommend this enough.	Shane Hansen	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A30ML8E13JVPIV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	5	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Bluetooth Is Not Fully Functional	This will not pair with my Sony Walkman NWZ-A17. Other Alexa devices do, so why doesn't the Echo Show? My Galaxy S7 pairs, but I keep my music on my Walkman, NOT my phone like many others do. For this reason, this is NOT "exactly like the Echo but better" like so many other 5 star reviews are claiming. And I have 2 of these. They both fail to pair.Their tech support is useless, one on the 28th telling me to wait for an overnight update, and another on the 29th telling me random stuff that has nothing to do with Bluetooth.We ordered these thinking they would be nice for the Ring Pro, to make us even lazier Americans, but I never bothered to set that up if I can't play my music on them. I was wondering what else I would use the screen for and I can't really think of anything. Lyrics and album art are great, but I don't stare at a screen when listening to music.Both of these are being returned today. Maybe the original will go on sale for Prime Day and I can get one that actually works.Feel free to thumb me down, but this review is truth. If you care at all about streaming with your mobile device, make sure it's compatible first.	disilluzion	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1JDEA2CSCAVX3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	11	1	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Great potential, maybe a bit too early	Honestly, I had forgotten that I pre-ordered this, so it was a bit of a surprise delivery.  Overall in my 24+ hours with it, I can see potential but it is still taking a bit of time to get used to navigating thru it.It is currently sitting on my office desk in the background.  My guess is that this is best suited for a workspace/kitchen counter.  Not sure that I like it next to bed, but do find the security camera or baby monitor integration useful in that setting.Pros:-  Speakers - clear and loud enough for the room.  Don't expect high fidelity, but they work well-  Screen - bright colors and easy to see/read within 3-5ft-  Smart home integration - so far worked well with my other smart home products-  Does everything that you expect from an Echo device just as well, if not better and faster than the speaker only versionCons:-  Still buggy - froze a number of times while switching between tasks-  Size/format - still undetermined about this one, it's larger than I expected but not too big, but it's size and fixed frame do limit its uses.  I would have liked to see a slimmer body that could be mounted to a wall if needed-  Price point - I think the price point is too high for a device that will ultimately provide more benefit to the marketplace thru increased consumer purchases, but it's still priced competitively for early adopters like myselfUndecided:-  User Interface - this one is tough, because I struggle with figuring out the best way to navigate thru this device, it seems to want you to use both voice and touch, which is definitely confusingOverall, I think the device will work great for someone looking to incorporate this into their Kitchen or workspace.  But I think the size and shape limit the market for the product.	M.O.	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2Y2M1EXI1PZ97/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	4	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	I'm Awaiting More... Until then it's "just okay"	Disappointed.I’m a tech girl and have multiple Echo’s in the house. They’re used for home automation, tasks, and entertainment. The excitement I had when this was announced was nothing short of great… I’d have an Echo/Tablet mix that would allow me better home automation integration and ease of use. I absolutely LOVED the idea.Then I set them up. Yes, I bought two.First off, if you have another adult on your account calling either one calls ALL of your devices. You cannot assign a device to someone, thus you can’t use it as an intercom. Fail.Many of the home automation claims the website makes simply do NOT work yet. Take Ring™ as an example. I love my Ring™ and cannot imagine not having one. But I really hate having to grab for my phone, or stop what I’m doing on my iPad to see who’s at the door. I really wanted the Show to do this for me. It doesn’t. Doesn’t show Live View, and doesn’t support audio during a Ring™ event. Useless. Ring™ claims this is upcoming functionality, but only buried deep within blogs and help desk tickets.I use the Echo to manage lights, thermostats, playing music, making lists, timers and alarms, sending messages, locking doors, and even managing my Roomba. I’ll be adding camera, sensors, and other devices soon now that I have the Show… or will once the Show actually integrates with these items.Currently it’s a touch screen Echo, and nothing more. It has the possibility of being amazing.I’ll update my review once more functionality is added. Until then… :)	Elle Hunt	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A3HT5TF0LMB785/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	4	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	There IS a User Manual	Just set up my Echo Show last night so I'm not ready to write a full review yet. ( other than to mention that, like many others, I also find the scrolling comments that can't be turned off to be very annoying,  and the main reason for taking off one star in my rating. I'll be including something about that in my feedback to Amazon.)I'm writing this comment mainly because I've noticed several people mentioned in their comments here that there is no kind of user manual for the Echo Show. In fact there is, but it's a bit hidden. In the Alexa App,  look at the top of the list of topics where your name shows. To the right of that is a very small question mark in a circle. If you click on that it will take you to the Help section which has user manuals for each of the Alexa products. There is one for the Echo Show and I did find it helpful to look through this.

B01J24C0TI	It is what it is - and it's awesome. Having a screen is so much better.	I've had the original Amazon Echo since it was first released. I've since acquired a couple of Echo Dots, and have turned my home into a formidable robot house. Nest thermostat, Hue lights, etc etc. And I'm able to walk around anywhere in my house, control all my gadgets, get the weather, add things to a shopping list, etc. with my lovely Echo devices. Having been thoroughly impressed with my Echos so far, I decided to bite the bullet and add the Echo Show to the family. I wasn't sure if it would find it's place or even if the new 7" Touchscreen would prove useful. Turns out, it certainly will and it definitely is.You have to realize what this product is, and I think that if you've watched any of the informational ads/videos Amazon has put out for this product, you should have a perfect idea of that. It's the original Echo, in a much boxier format, with a touchscreen. That's it guys. It's not going to suddenly be able to mow your lawn for you, trim your beard or give you a haircut (or anything else that involves scissors or ridiculous expectations). However just by trying a few of the 'Things to Try' written on the nifty little card included with the Show, I quickly realized how much nicer having the screen is going to be. Examples:1) I use the Alexa shopping list often. Now I can ask to SEE my shopping list, and even make edits right there on the Show, without having to open the app or go online.2) Exact same thing with my To-Do list. Maybe others don't have any issues with this, but I despised not being able to remove/edit items without having to open the app.3) Every morning when I request the weather, I now see today's forecast as well as the next three days. I love that. Also, the current weather and time is now displayed on the screen at (almost) all times!4) On that note, I ask Alexa what time it is way too often. Maybe this one's just personal due to my lack of clocks in the house, but being able to see the time is a plus. I know I know, a $1 clock has the same functionality. I get that, it's just nice.5) Want to SEE movies playing near you? SEE restaurants near you and their information (open times, reviews, etc)? Now you can, and it's much nicer than listening to Alexa's (lovely) voice read it all out to you.6) Video calls. It may take a while to catch on, but it's a huge selling point trying to be pushed by Amazon. Once more people have Shows, I can see it being an amazing feature. Even if it's just members of your family or ones close to you - being able to just ask to video call and see their faces so easily is pretty awesome.7) SEE your timers. I constantly use Alexa for timers when cooking, etc. but it's a little annoying having to constantly ask 'Alexa, how much time is left' when I want to know how much longer before I can stuff my face with chocolate chip cookies. Now the timer(s) can be seen right on the screen.8) SEE your calendar and your upcoming events. It's much nicer than just hearing them listed out slowly and awkwardly.9) SEE more things.I know the above isn't groundbreaking. But honestly, this isn't meant to be a groundbreaking device. Besides the Video Calling, this is essentially the Amazon Echo with a touchscreen. The benefit that I see, as shown in my list above, is that the things that you used to do on the Echo are now greatly enhanced by having a screen to SHOW you things. It may seem silly to some, but for only $40-50 bucks more than the original Echo, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase the Show.Oh and one more thing. The speaker on this thing is fantastic. Maybe not so for you audiophiles, but for it's size and purpose, it's fantastic. The microphone is also proving to be the best yet. Alexa has perfectly understood nearly everything I've asked so far, with even better accuracy than my original Echo/Echo Dots.The decision is yours. Do you think being able to SEE things on your Echo would be helpful? Do you use the calendar, shopping and to-do lists often? Are you interested in Video Calling? If yes to any of these, or if you are a newbie to the Echo family and are looking for your first Echo device, I would definitely recommend you picking up the Echo Show.But hey, what do I know. I'm just an average dude.	Average Dude	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A1PVRD76I3ERQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	5	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Not fully realized	There are things I like, and things I don't. Setup was easy, but overall I think the product is not great. I had hoped that it would be a nice digital photo frame (as a screen saver), be able to help me with recipes in the kitchen, and then provide general Alexa powered voice services.The digital photo frame element is pretty bad. I have to tell it to show me photos which it will only display until it decides to go to sleep. Those photos are pulled from my Prime Photos library, but it doesn't appear to allow selection of a specific album. Not great. Also, the amount of time the photos are displayed before moving to the next also seems to be unchangeable.The recipe thing could work (it pulls up stuff on Allrecipes), but I don't think I can easily catalog my own recipes and have it dictate specific steps. Also, the screen turns off after a little bit, so then I'd need to touch the thing or figure out how to get it back to my previous view. Also, in order to use it in the kitchen I'd need to unplug it from its usual location and find a good outlet for it. I'm not going to do that. I don't want it in the kitchen all the time due to lack of counter space. The Show won't function without being plugged in, so it's really not as portable as pretty much any other screened device that I own. This is not only inconvenient for the kitchen aspect, but if I wanted to use it for the video calls I need to set it up in an appropriate area and commit to it. Some degree of battery powered portability would have been great.The voice recognition is fantastic, and the Echo responded well to my seven year old (who is not the most clear speaker). One quirk I noted is that when he asked it to play some stupid cartoon show he had been watching it automatically started playing from the point that he had left off on the tv earlier in the day. I asked Alexa to restart the episode, but she can't do that. You can't even touch the screen and restart the episode, it simply isn't an option. You can't even jump to the next episode. It's strange.

B01J24C0TI	Developers pls check sony dash!classic ring not working!	I am replacing my bedside clock with echo show. I was using dony dash for over five years and worked teally nice. So pla developers check the night clock function of sony dash and implement it to echo. Night mode just show the clock big letters and dimmed.  Second do not put one dash on 2.4 and one 5 mhz wifi on your asus router or 2.4 one goes crazy like changing the songs every second on pandora than acting up. Tech support was useless. My router is asus rt5300 merlin. Hope this helps someone. Other than that sound is nice amd has potential. But sony dadh had huge potential but sony messed it up so lets wait and see.Also i have two classic ring doorbells and they are not working as advertised on echo show. I did discovery and show finds them. Than when i ask alexa to show my fromt door, she says not available. This was one of the main reasons that i bought echo show. Disappointed amd hope it will get fixed!!! So for now no go with ring classicUpdate2: tunein radio is not working properly. You pick a channel, it plays... than pick another one and it doesn't switch to that channel. Guess what one hour later alexa comes on and says i cant find that channel while i was sleeping.

B01J24C0TI	You can't COMPLETELY turn off the screen!  Not good for a bedroom appliance (camera security issues aside...)	Just got my two "shows".  OK I guess, but sorta Dead On Arrival for me...I wanted to replace an echo in my bedroom with this but there is no way to COMPLETELY turn off the screen when its not being used/queried!  You can ask Alexa to "turn off the screen" but it still glows with a black background and displays a clock.  (That's not "OFF" BTW!)  Even with the black background and only the clock (Echo's definition of "off"), its still too bright for use in the bedroom.  So I guess I'll have to find some other use for it...Hopefully, enough people will comment on this such shortcoming that a software update will TRULY provide the ability to TURN OFF the SCREEN!

B01J24C0TI	Potentially great next gen Echo, very useful, with one glaring design flaw that impacts usability.	Edit July 5, 2017:Just found out that the Show does not support bluetooth headsets.  Another pretty glaring omission.  For a device that supports calling (video or audio) it absolutely should support bluetooth headsets.  Because of this you are FORCED to have calls where anyone can hear the call whether you want them to or not.  If you are the type of person that thinks anyone around you should be able to hear both sides of a conversation then this won't be an issue.  If you feel that you might want the other callers audio to be private... you are out of luck.Hopefully this will be addressed by Amazon at some point.Original review:So far the Show is proving to be a useful device and the feature set over the regular Echo's is great.  Video calling works wonderfully and the display (and capabilities it brings) is a welcome addition.That said there is one glaring issue that I expected to be a problem and I'm surprised Amazon released the product with this design.The camera angle.Amazon I have to wonder if you did much beta testing of the product or really thought through the design.  You have a device that can be used for video calling AND as a "room monitor" using the drop-in feature to view another Show's camera on demand... the problem?  Any NORMAL positioning of the Show results in a very limited view of the room... because the camera is pointing too far up!  This design flaw is so obvious I cannot believe you released the product like this.  It could have been great but now it's mediocre.  You should have made the camera have a tilt capability to point it down lower.  This is a glaring issue that will frustrate many of your customers.Another potential issue is that it appears you can only pair bluetooth speakers, not headsets, so if you want to make a video call to another Show you are forced to have audio through the speaker.  I have only tested with a Plantronics Voyager 5200 so far, which is a bluetooth headset (mic and earpiece) and it would pair but would not function.  I suspect the bluetooth headset profile is not supported.  This is a shame if you want to do video calls but have the audio be more provide (ie in a home office setting).I'm sure the device will improve over time and in spite of the above issues I am happy with the device so far.  I'll be testing with a audio only bt headphone soon to see if that works as opposed to a bt headset.	K.

B01J24C0TI	Great alarm clock and knowledge tool for pre-typing kids. Home intercom too.	I have used the original Echo for many months as well as the Google Home. I upgraded to the Echo Show to replace my kid's alarm clock and it works very well for that purpose. You can read the time anytime as the clock is always-on.ALARM CLOCK-Setting alarms is easy - "Set daily alarm for ...". Viewing all the current alarms is easy - "Show me my alarms".-Setting timers is also easy - "Set timer for....".-Much easier to set alarms compared to the old-fashioned type. Kids can easily set their own alarms and timers.FEATURES-Does spelling and math. My kids are constantly asking me to spell words and solve simple math problems. Now they can ask Alexa "What is 100 times 100" and both hear and see the answer.-Watching Prime videos directly on the device. Say "Just Add Magic Season 1"and then use the touchscreen to view the desired episode.-Asking any trivia question. "Show me a picture of a Titanaboa".-Plays music and displays lyrics for some songs in real-time. Could function as a simple karaoke player. My kids like to hear lullabies as they go to sleep and Alexa has a good lullaby station - "Play lullabies". (Note: If you mistakenly say the singular "lullaby", it plays a single song called Lullaby.)INTERCOM-It is not obvious, but I managed to figure out how to use Alexa as an in-home intercom. You need to activate the "calling and messenging" feature which requires your phone number. Then you command "Drop in on (echo name)" and a video chat will start up. Pretty cool.-There are no customization options for the intercom. You can't easily reject or block incoming chats. There is no instant mute button either. So if you are doing something important like on a business call on your cell phone, an incoming Echo call could interrupt you.BUILD QUALITY-The fit and finish is immediately impressive out of the box. The entire unit has a nice heft that makes it feel like a quality device.SCREEN-The screen resolution is excellent for text - no pixelation visible. For videos, the resolution could stand some improvement though.-Love the touchscreen.SOUND-Quality is plenty good and can get very loud. Speakers now face directly toward you unlike with the previous Echo and Google Home.-There are hard volume up/down buttons but unfortunately no mute button.COLORS-I got one in both black and white. The black version has a more cohesive appearance because the front of the unit (which is black) matches the rest of it. The finish of both is good so there is no bad choice here.ANY MISSING FEATURES?-It would be nice if I could create separate Echo accounts of each of my kids' Echo's. That way my kids can't access my personal info (schedule, shopping list, make calls, etc.). I would also like to set restrictions to content based on age.OVERALLThe Echo Show is basically a tablet computer with Alexa-capabilities built into a very nice display case with speakers. The first thing I thought when I used the device is "The future is here". The build quality is impressive especially given the relatively low price. For pre-typing kids, it is a useful information retriever because it responds to voice commands.There are some improvements that could be made. I wish there was a much more robust customization ability for all its features which is especially important if you have multiple Echos around the house for multiple family members. The resolution is good but could be better for videos.All in all, this is an impressive futuristic device. Adding a touchscreen to the Echo makes a huge difference in interactivity, usefulness, and fun. At worst, it is the future of alarm clocks. At best, it is a multimedia entertainment and knowledge tool with intercom ability.

B01J24C0TI	Show is just not ready yet...	It absolutely does everything an Echo can do and it does sound pretty good but for me the constant scrolling on the screen was way past irritating. I love the Echo and Echo Dots that I own but the Show did nothing more for me than the screenless Echoes did. I think this device could be great but it needs some work. It needs to allow for configuration of what you see on the screen - I do NOT want constant scrolling of whatever Amazon decides to put on it nor do I want even the slightest possibility of ads on it EVER. I also want clear instructions on how to make the Show work with an IP camera without finding only promises but no instructions. This product seems to me to still be a BETA product and I do not want to pay for a product that I do not feel was ready for release. I have already sent my Show back for refund and will not purchase another til it's actually ready for Prime time.

B01J24C0TI	Not for grandma :(  -- and won't sync with Audible.	Ordered 2 -- one for me and one for Grandma.  I enjoy mine -- although I really wish it had a "photo frame" feature instead of automatically returning to the home screen after a short interval.I got Grandma one so she could keep in touch with all of her grandkids -- all of whom bought Shows.  Alas, its not for Grandma because she does not have a smart phone.  This is a major flaw.  Without a smartphone for syncing contacts - the Show is a brick  (and cant even be used as a photo frame -- see above).After using for a few days I have more issues that I find frustrating and have downgraded.  The one that is super annoying is that it screws up my Audible book syncing.  Alexa remembers its last location but does not sync with my other listening devices.  It then cause my other devices to want to sync with it.  Aurgg!	rlwesty	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2B1XI4LZQOFX3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	8	2	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Horrible excuse for an alarm clock	Pros:Plays music from Pandora well, and has a speaker equivalent in quality to the Small Jawbone Jambox.It's a neat novelty item for kids and people who have never "played" with Alexa.Cons:Doesn't understand you 20% of the time (and I speak very clear English).Has occasional hiccups with Bluetooth connectivity which causes delays in commands.Horrible excuse for an alarm clock...cannot turn the screen off...can dim it quite a bit, but the glow will still illuminate the room.When the power goes out, it cannot be relied on as an alarm clock.Weather reports are fairly unspecific..."partly cloudy with a chance of rain" doesn't tell me much.Can't send text messages to iphone users without using the Alexa app on your phone to read them.Alexa's voice is very monotone and gets old quick...especially when reading some of the worthless news it tells you.There is no USB port to connect or charge any other devices to it.It has to be plugged into an outlet to function.Bottom line is to save your $180 until another, updated version comes along that has some better functionality.  At this juncture, it's just a mediocre speaker with a screen.	Chad Clayton	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AWSYJ7ERXJD88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	2	2017/06/30

B01J24C0TI	A new part of my Amazon Family!  Now the SHOW!	Today I added 2 new members to my growing Amazon family of Echo products.  The Echo Show.  This brings my totals to (2) Echos (6) Dots (3) Fire TVs (1) Tap and (1) Dash Wand and several Dash Buttons.  I have developed this ecosystem to run my smart house from top to bottom which includes WeMos, Philips Hue, Netgear Airo, Logitech Harmony and Nest.When the Echo Show was first introduced on the Amazon site I was thinking this would be the replacement for the original Echo products but after watching the videos and thinking about my strategy on placement I realized they are complementary, not replacements.  I went ahead and pre-ordered 1 in black and 1 in white.  The idea that I'd use the black one in the bedroom with the ability to be an alarm clock and a way to get my news before getting out of the bed and the white one in the kitchen to do routine kitchen choirs and add things to my shopping lists.  This means that I need to find new homes for the items in those locations - not really a hard task now that Amazon has improved the E.S.P. within the devices.  I will be able to put a Dot in the garage and move an Echo to the lanai.I am including pictures of all of the packaging, details, colors, assessories for each of the new Shows.  All of these pictures are taken by me and are not professional in any way.  If you would like additional pictures please let me know and I'll try to put more up.SETUP (number 1):  Once I unpacked my Shows I started getting the first one setup.  I ran into a couple of problems right off the bat because you setup the device right on the screen and not using the Alexa app.  It prompted me to connect to my network and that was easy.  Then it asked me for my Amazon credentials so I tried to log in and kept getting a warning over and over so I double checked my password to make sure I was using the right one.  I let it sit for about 30 minutes thinking it might be updating in the background but everytime I tried to log in I got the same thing.  I went to the Amazon website and looked up my devices and it showed both of my Echo Shows - so I went back and unplugged the device and plugged it back in and voila - it worked!  The first disapointment was it needed to update right out of the box, but most new products do this now so I waited for the update to finish and install and then Alexa started talking to me!  She was ALIVE!  There is a video at the start that you are kind of forced to watch but you can drag the progress bar to the end to skip over it.  She came up and showed me the time and started giving me suggestions right away!SETUP (number 2):  This one worked like a champ right out of the box.  Not sure if it was due to the first one hanging up or not but I plugged it in and connected it to my internet and she asked me if I was "David" and once I said yes it ran the update, played the video and things were grand!So I started to play with my new toy.  Asked for a few of the usual things, dimmed some lights, changed the A/C with Nest, played a song from a playlist.  Everything worked as expected.WHAT I LIKE:  This is a cool little box with a video screen.  It is touch sensitive and you can provide some input that way or just say "Alexa" and she is ready to listen to what you want.  The folks at Amazon have updated her voice a bit and made it a little smoother (this was on all my devices about a week ago) and her speach pattern is a bit more (human?) realistic.  I knew this would have a bigger footprint because the moved the sound to the bottom and gave it bigger & better audio.  It sounds really good!  Not top of the line sound but better than you would expect from a smart device on your kitchen counter.  I like it but I know there are going to be people out there that bash the sound quality but for the price I think it is on point.  The video screen quality is also good.  The touch is very responsive and works as expected.  You have 3 buttons at the top to mute and volumn + and volumn - if you don't feel like barking the command to turn it up or down.WHAT I DONT LIKE:  This is tough but I know I will find a few things that are not quite up to what I was expecting.  I just haven't found any yet.  I was a bit upset when setting up the first one but quickly forgot about that once it was up and running.  As with all new technology you just need to be patient.  I wish there were more color options but I'm sure a 3rd party will come out with "skins" so right now you have Black or White.  White works well in my kitchen and black is fine for my bedroom.  I do wish that when you ask for the news in the morning while still in bed it would be accompanied with video but right now it is the same news update I had - audio only.I'm looking forward to everything Amazon will do with this new toy.  The smart toys are now available from all the major providers and they all do things a bit different.  I invested in Amazon because they were first to marked and I was a beta tester for the original Echo device.  I think I will stick with my Amazon ecosystem or "Family" because as I mentioned earlier I own about everything they have released and everything is at a better price-point.  I'll keep my audio equipment for playing audio and my toys to run my smarthome.  Almost everyone has parternered with Amazon so it is getting easier to do most anything with an Echo!I hope this review helps you make an informed decision!  I'd be happy to answer any quesions you may have so just look me up and let me know.  I will update this review over time as things change (the good and the bad).  For now, I'm going to enjoy my Echo Show and see what fun things I can do!

B01J24C0TI	Nightstand Thoughts	 This product is amazing. It’s a tad overpriced for the materials, but underpriced for what it will become capable of.The sound & screen are fine for the device. I’m happy with both. Check out other reviews for better details on that.I originally bought one for the kitchen to replace an Echo Dot, but decided to try it as a nightstand clock, replacing my Amazon Echo.The help/instructions don’t exist (as of this writing). The ‘ambient mode’ is a tad too bright as a nightstand clock, but it is still better than anything else smart on market now.A few bumps regarding best way to set it up, I sometimes listen to TWiT podcasts at night and sure enough about 5am a host said ‘Alexa’ and it woke everyone up, etc. the Echo didn’t seem to be as sensitive.To mute the device you are left with a red led and red bar on. So that’s not really a good option yet. A ‘night time’ mode should be added that lets you set up brightness, volume, & clock (& maybe other info). See attached video.You can turn the screen off, but that requires disabling the ambient clock.With that said, the home screen is helpful and I love the data surfacing my clock, interesting facts, and tips. It feels always fresh. I watched/listened to an entire TV episode without any issue at all.The angle was also fine for my set up.On day one, it’s not perfect, but the problems are easily excused for what the device is and what it will undoubtably become.I love it as my nightstand clock.

B01J24C0TI	1 of 2 had bad speakers	So far I am enjoying the Echo Show. I have read a lot of reviews about what people expected rather than rating the device on its own. I had no issues with connectivity or adding learned tasks. I did find out not all EZVIZ camera systems are currently able to be viewed thru the show. The Show does recognize the cameras but I receive a message this option is not supported by the cameras.The Show has been responsive and has quickly retrieved requested information such as stock quotes and box scores. The Show was also surprising easy to play movies thru prime; not that I expect to watch anything thru this small of a screen. My one issue is I have to replace one of the Shows, which is the reason for 3 stars. The speakers sounded blown out. For being a brand new device I would have expected better quality control from Amazon.Once I receive the new device I may adjust the rating.Downgrading my rating based upon interaction with customer service/tech support. They had me go thru steps to factory reset the device when the problem was obviously with the speaker before they would do the replacement. I went thru the process of doing a factory reset and reconnecting the Show. Exact same problem.

B01J24C0TI	Should be called the Meh Show, not Echo Show.	I've had the original Alexa since it first came out Jan 2015 and have been impressed with the functionality Amazon has added to it. Since Amazon has had over two years to play with Alexa, I would have thought that the new Echo Show would have been more impressive than it is. At this point, it's nothng more than the original Echo with an added 7" screen. Not too impressed with what you can do with the screen. A cheap used iPad Mini with Siri  can do more at this point. Also, the sound quality isn't much better than the original Echo. Can't compare to a Sonos:1.Back it goes to Amazon until they make major improvements. Sorry Jeff, nice try, but you whiffed this one.

B01J24C0TI	Jury still out on the added screen	I bought the original Echo the day it came out.  I always said if it had a screen it could be so much more---I'm still waiting for the more part after having the Show for a few days.  Like the original Echo when it first came out, it took a while and some updates to reach potential.  This Show still needs those updates.  First thing to note is that it's not very customizable.  You're very limited with the settings.  You can change the background pics and a couple of the scrolling options, but that's about it.  I was expecting more of a tablet experience, but now as I'm typing this it is more like my Fire tablet where you don't have the same ability to customize like you would a standard Android Tablet.  I'm just very disappointed in the limitations.  I was hoping that you could change the screen to show like a weather station, etc.  Just more options.  As others have stated, there is a constant message that gives you suggests to "Try" on the screen.  You can hide this, in a way, by turning off the scrolling and just keeping it on your calendar, which we use Google calendar linked to the Alexa app.  I don't mind the "Try" scrolling right now because sometimes it's good to see what other things it can do.  But I could see wanting to turn this feature off at some point....but you can't.....right now.  Maybe an update will cure that.The next pet peeve was just how to get around and use the thing.  Thankfully, CNET has a good write up on their web page on how to use some of the main features and set up your Echo Show, other Echos and the Alexa app on how to use the camera remotely.  There was little to no guidance on these features and you really have to explore the thing.  I had to figure out on my own to try "Alexa, go to the settings screen" to get to settings.  For a while I was trying "Alexa, go to settings" and she responded, "Hm, I don't know the answer to the question I heard" quite a few times.I want to say that it seems she can't hear as clearly as my original Echo.  Others have mentioned that many times, the light turns blue and....nothing...literally no response, which is odd because she usually tells you she couldn't hear you or doesn't understand.  But it's literally nothing with me standing right in front of her...er...it..  :)Lastly, so far, the camera.  This thing is an odd shape to begin with because they didn't put chintzy speakers in it.  But since they put the face at an angle, the camera also faces upward.  So using this on a side table about waist high, when you drop in, you see mostly ceiling.  You can't see anything below about the 3.5-  4 ft level.  So if you are dropping in on your grandkids, well, you won't be able to see them.  I would only see the forehead of my 7 year old son, who is slightly tall for his age.  They should have kept the camera angle at least straight ahead and level and not the same angle as the face.  Now if I want to use it to drop in while I'm out of the house, I have to stack a few kids books under the back end of it to make the camera face straight ahead so I can see kids, pets, state of the house, etc...This seems to me like the developers only thought that people would be standing right in front of it, faces 2 ft away, standing and staring at the camera for this to really work as a "drop in" feature...that or they have a preference of staring at ceilings.So....those are my initial thoughts.  I gave it a 3 which means "I like it" which may seem contrary to what I put above, but I bought this knowing there would be updates to help it's functionality.  The 3 is based on my past experience with the original Echo and that Echo growing into our daily usage.  I expect the same for this...except for the camera issue, the fix for that might be some kind of mount that makes it face forward.

B01J24C0TI	I absolutely love the Echo Show	I absolutely love the Echo Show!  Some thoughts:1. The screen is not too bright for use in your bedroom as an alarm clock.  Go to settings on the device. Tap display. Make sure Ambient Clock is turned on. Set Brightness Level to about 1/3 and make sure Adaptive Brightness is turned on.  Then use the Do Not Disturb feature (you can schedule this feature for every day at certain times, turn on manually from the screen, or turn on with your voice)  This is how I have mine set and I have no issue with the brightness level at night or during the day.2.  The screen size is perfect for your desk, kitchen counter, or nightstand.  Some people have commented that the screen is small for watching movies or television shows which is true.  But remember, this not meant to be a TV.3.  I am glad Amazon first came out with the Echo with no screen.  This forced me to get used to using my voice.  That took time to get used to since most of us are used to tapping on screens.  That being said, remember this is a voice activated device first, not a tablet.  That is why there are not many options to use the touchscreen.  However, I'm sure in the future Amazon will be adding more touch screen options.4.  Amazon Echo Remote pairing - setup is different than on the other Echo devices.  Instead of going in the app to set up - go to Settings on the Echo Show, then go to Device Options, scroll down and you will see the Pair Amazon Echo Remote option.5.  Having a screen enhances Alexa.  For example, ask for the weather today and Alexa tells you but also shows you more weather info for the week.6.  I also purchased two Arlo Q cameras to work with the Alexa Show.  Setup was easy and the cameras are working seamlessly with the Show.  It takes about 6-8 seconds for the cameras to pull up on the Show but that was expected.  It takes my phone the same amount of time.If you are on the fence about any of the Alexa devices, give yourself time to learn all she can do and to learn how she will fit into your life.  I haven't regretted my purchase.  And remember, Alexa is also learning all the time!

B01J24C0TI	It was easy to set up	It was easy to set up.  The main problems I have with it are the software - you cannot change or choose the information on the screen (so for example if I just want to display time and weather - I cannot do that - there is stupid stuff at the bottom like "try X..." that cannot be erased or hidden.) It is complicated to figure out how to change or delete "cards" and how to stop the screen from constantly changing (and some of the text will keep changing all day no matter what - no way to turn it off).  I tried playing youtube videos on it - and it does ultimately work - but it is so convoluted and frustrating on how to get the video you want - that I will probably not bother.  It is not fully formed yet and I found it frustrating unless you just want to listen to amazon music.Update - after using it for almost a week - I took it down and went back to my dot. I have an echo and two dots set up and I love them. The show does not seem to pick up as well on voice recognition, the speakers are not very good, getting it to play what you want on video is a frustrating chore, and dealing with the home or calendar screen is a hassle. I hope most of these problems are fixable - but at this point - I prefer the dot/echo.	pcs	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1PQS2IR1W9LJJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	8	2	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Great Product, Video Intercom Awesome, Major bluetooth bug.	PROsBasically its a Echo with a screen.  The video is nice and the video intercom is awesome and well worth the price alone.  The intercom functions work well but seem to work even better with the SHOW's as it does not go one way at a time as the DOT's seem to do. Looking forward to updates just llike on the echo a work in progress.Con's: There are a few Bluetooth Bugs:1. Bluetooth cuts out and reverts back to speaker during intercom mode.  This is annoying as hell and needs to be a priority fix.2. Bluetooth volume is lower than the DOT's and you almost have to have the SHOW at 8-10 to get decent volume. Needs to be fixed3. Bluetooth does not automattically connect in the car from your cell when getting an intercom call using the alexa app (ios).  And if you call out using bluetooth in the car, when you hang up the car bluetooth does not revert back to what was playing.  (Even playing Amazon music on cell)I really think they have a hit here with the video intercom function the killer app. Also, I hope they make a DOT sized echo with HDMI out .

B01J24C0TI	Great Addition to Echo. Cant remove onscreen Alexa "suggestions to try". Restricting Alexa to using Bing hobbles the experience.	So, I've  had Echo's ever since they came out. I have a dot in the bedroom and the regular echo in the Entertainment room. I've found then to be very useful to the point of stopping myself form uttering "alexa..... " when Im out. So, when the Echo Show was announed, I pre-ordered it immediately. I'm very pleased with the appearance and the sound rivals the mini Bose speaker use from time to time.  So far, it's been great, when ask for my news briefings, it plays the video of the guy behind the microphone narrating. When Iaske for weather, it displayes the weather as well as speaks to it. My brother ordered one as well and the video conferencing ability beteen this device and another is phenominal. Great sound and video. And the "drop in" feature that allows you to remotely peek into your home from the device to see what's what, is also great. I have much more to experiment with but so far, I"m pleased.....Now the complaint(s)Amazon's developers, according to the support person I spoke with via chat, have taken it upon themselves to make it impossible to remove a constant flow of "suggestions to try" from the display. There are settings to remove, news feeds, and other clutter but this one is not changeable. "It's because it's a new product and the developers want the users to learn about the Echo Show's abilities" says Amazon support. So, Amazon believes that we are not intelligent enough to use the Alexa App. or read on-line about the feature set of our new devices. I'm all for suggestions but, ONLY If I opt in for it. Imagine if the regular Amazon Echo uttered suggestion of things to try from time to time without prompt. It would surely find it's way into the nearest closet or out on the front lawn. This device is very nice looking. I would like to keep it in my main entertainment area with a nice background, date and temp. displayed. Not a bunch of extra information clutter that Don't want. Hopefully the ability to turn off this "feature" will be added in a very near firmware update.The second burning issue is Amazon's insistence to us ing as the default and ONLY search engine that the Echo devices use. This is a head scratcher as I can think of several search engines that are far superior to Bing. No wonder I get so many "I'm sorry I don't know that" or similar from Alexa requests for information. I'll pit Google against Bing in any search for a fuller more comprehensive return of information. There are a couple work around options out there but they 1. require a lot of work. 2. Require a pay account with Amazon AWS or similar. This is such a simple thing that i believe is being driven by business politics vs producing the most effective home assistance tool possible. I ended up buying an Google Home device for my general requests for information that Alexa cant handle do to it's hobbled attachment to an inferior search engine. Please Please Please allow Alexa to use other search engines, including Google, as her source for info searching.Thanks.	M.

B01J24C0TI	What I like: * Setup process was easy and painless	Looking back, I pre-ordered as soon as I could, and it arrived on release day. Would I do it all over again? Probably not.What I like:* Setup process was easy and painless.* Excellent screen quality.* Sound quality is the best yet for any Echo device.What I **don't** like - the basis for my three star review:* All the little suggestions for "Try 'Alexa, do this or that or something else' " -- these are a nuisance, and there's no way to turn them off.* Screen is always on.

B01J24C0TI	Awesome, except home screen functionality is terrible	My stars may be harsh, because this is mostly a really great product.  But there is one thing that really irks me about it: You don't have full control of the home screen!  At a minimum, I should be able to set it so that just the "Upcoming Events" is shown-- however, there is no way to turn off it flipping back and forth between a screen that shows suggestions of things to try! You can turn off any other screen ("called home cards"), but not the "Things to Try".  This irks me very much, because ideally, they would have a really awesome home card which shows time, weather, and if any messages are available at the top, and then upcoming events (or news) at the bottom.  Their current settings don't let you do anything so ideal. It's not well thought out-- and because cycling between "upcoming events" and "things to try" is so annoying, I had to drop this from a 5 down to a 2. Also, I am not quite sure how to have it go to a blank screen when it doesn't see any motion for a while.Besides that, my internet speed is around 65mb/5mb, and my parents is maybe around 10mb/1mb.  When on the same wifi (in the same house), the video was great. But when calling from different houses, the video was choppy and a lot of lag.  Even when disabling video, when making a call the sound had a lot of lag (like approaching 1 second). That was with 2 tests on two different nights, and granted, my parents network is slow, but that doesn't explain the lag (it's ADSL over copper twin, and far away from a CO)-- I think from what I recall, the lag was maybe ~0.5 second when on the same wifi.I also have the original echo "cylinder", and I like this "show" better. It naturally does all the things the old one does, and has some of the same problems, such as sometimes it doesn't hear you well and you have to repeat the command-- but it is just much more useful with a display.The one feature that I love is that it shows lyrics when it is playing music.  I have a 6 year old who sings karaoke using it.It's slightly bigger than I thought it would be, but it's no problem.

B01J24C0TI	Failure to connect	So excited to receive this. But unlike every single Glenview device we have connected to our WiFi, Echo Show won't connect. Gives no information. The app for the phone doesn't even have the Show as a choice, even as product is being shipped. Big rollout fail.

B01J24C0TI	Some things work great, but not the calendar functionality.	Works great for some things, but it reports an error anytime it tries to pull up my Office 365 calendar; one of the main reasons I purchased the Show.  The calendar features work perfectly on all the other Echo Dots I have in the house, so there are clearly some bugs to be worked out with the Show.	T.

B01J24C0TI	Upsetting.....	Very upsetting that there is no way to turn off the cluttered text on the main home screen.  Just got off the phone with technical support and they confirmed that there is no way to get rid of the things to try text messages.  It's something hey are working on.  So basically you can set a background pic but can't see it through the advertisement.

B01J24C0TI	Disappointing; Return to Amazon.	(Update:  After my wife also decided she hates the Echo Show, we shipped them back.)  The Show is a big disappointment.  Perhaps my expectations were off, but I thought it would do something that the Amazon Echo doesn't do.  To the contrary, Amazon just added a screen and lousy microphone to the Echo.  Rarely does the screen add anything to the experience.  What it does show in response to requests is usually ugly, incomplete or just plain wrong.  It's almost as if Amazon rushed this out without any testing whatsoever.  It is a touch screen, but there is no reason to touch it.  It has no icons or internet browser or (really) anything.  It has a few settings, but they don't allow for even meager levels of customization.  For instance, the Show's main task seems to be spewing dumb suggestions all day long like "Ask Alexa to play Jeopary!"  Worse yet, there is no way to turn off the annoying and distracting suggestions.  Amazon forces their inane suggestions on your 24/7. The speakers are louder, but the quality of the sound is worse.  On the further negative side, Alexa often doesn't comprehend what you ask it to do.  The microphone just works very poorly most of the time.  Sometimes it listens (blue line), but it just doesn't respond -- not at all.  And sometimes it just gets stuck with the blue line (indicating Alexa is listening) staying on the screen for many long minutes.  I can't see any value whatsoever in this device.  It seems like someone said, "Let's add a screen," but didn't give the product a single thought past that simple notion.  It isn't a tablet as it has no browser, it doesn't have any Apps, you can't customize the homepage (even to make it like an clock), you can't turn off the creeper video camera without muting the microphone (DOH!, this thing is just a mess.  The people giving it 5 stars are fan boys who want to be part of Vine.  Don't be deceived, the Show is pure trash..

B01J24C0TI	Quick Observations	I received two Echo Show devices and set them up immediately.Some quick observations:1. The Ring Doorbell Pro integration is available via the Amazon Echo Skill.  (I was told the Ring Doorbell Pro integration is not yet available, per Ring tech support on 6/28. I was told it would be ready "soon". Ok, my bad. I should have checked the skill list first.  Ring Tech support should have known the app was available.  Call it a wash.2. You can simultaneously stream an Amazon Prime Video Movie A on Echo Show #1 and an Amazon Prime Video Movie B on Echo Show #2.3.The screen is fixed, so if you want to adjust the screen for glare, you need to move the entire device.4. The screen does not go completely dark, so putting this device in a bedroom could disrupt sleep.5. There no indentations for mounting this device to a bracket.	mp	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1FVGPR0XXKB3Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2017/06/30
B01J24C0TI	Evolutionary not revolutionary.	A nice addition to what seems like my continuously growing collection of electronic gadgets that are supposed to enhance my quality of life. Since I already have multiple versions of Alexa ('Tap' is still my favorite), Fire TV, Apple TV, iPads...well, you get it.  Did I really need this? No.  But, it works as advertised and I suppose there's a place for it out there where it will do more than it does for me....which is add to my collection of 21st century gizmos.  Does everything that they say it will do, but nothing that I don't already have in another form.  Nice product that works as advertised.  Which is more than you can say for a lot of stuff, including the $50,000+ SUV that's parked in my garage.

B01J24C0TI	Totally in love with my Echo Show	Totally in love with my Echo Show! Have 2 of them and they're amazing! I get my briefing from Fox News in the morning along with my calendar and weather for the day and any to do reminders. After I get what I need I get great music through the built in Dolby speakers. Video calls are great quality and brings that next level to being personal. Just wish I could choose her name guys, and voice ❤️ My wife is jealous already.	Mark S.

I ask it to turn off it screen but it only dim it. Way too bright to sleep with. I'm hoping amazon would do something before having to return it.

B01J24C0TI	The Echo Show Takes Alexa To Another Level!	I had to admit that I was very reluctant but was pleasantly surprised. I was already happy with my Echo Dot and just got a Dash. I purchased my relatives an Echo so I wasn’t sure if I needed it but it definitely takes the Alexa experience to another level.A few highlights:- Very easy to set-up. After the updates, it automatically initiates the set-up to connect to your Wi-Fi and it’s even quicker if you are already registered to it.- Screen is clear and crisp.o Songs plays have lyrics (Karaoke party!)o I could see the screen in all angleso From the videos I saw from trailers, there was no stutter or lag.- Surprisingly good sound:o The original Echo has a surprisingly deep bass and sharp tremble and this is just as good and a bit better.o The 8-Microphone Array allows me to say commands a room away easily. It picks up my voice much better than the previous versions.- Video calling:o If you someone else has one, you can video chat them with an instant command.A few things to note:- Because of the speakers, it looks like a small CRT.- Alexa is still getting smarter so it lags a bit in versatility in commands specifically questions like Siri.- Make sure you take the wrapper out. I know that seems obvious but the speaker has two wrappers and it sounds muffled.- It is the most expensive Echo product to date but there are promotions if you buy two.- I wish some of the functions such as the news briefing had videos as it is basically a recording.Overall, Amazon continues to impress me with their evolution of their Echo products. As Alexa gets smarter, the experience with all Echo products will get better.	dafobulous1	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A2JXYUQV9QL1P2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	12	5	2017/06/29

B01J24C0TI	My new home companion	 I've been using it for only a day, but I liked it so far. All this is new to me, so let me share my experience.I haven't owned previous "Alexa" devices but decided to give a try to this Echo Show. Actually, I'm glad that I didn't buy Echo Dot as having a screen has so many privileges. I'm a more visual person, so I like having things shown, rather than just heard. For example, if I haven't heard about the weather forecast, or I want to check my current timer or which song is playing right now, I don't need to ask one more time, I just look at the screen. Usually, Alexa understand me very well, even my terrible accent :)The main feature of this Echo Show is video calling. I'm so glad that now I can call to my husband or parents, just using a simple voice command, holding my daughter in my hands. So far it works great, no glitches, no interruptions, quality of the voice and picture are surprisingly good.My husband spends about 50% of his work time on business trips, and have such a helper in the living room or kitchen (in my case it's kitchen) is really nice. Usually, I'm using Skype for video calling, but sometimes during the cooking, it's quite complicated to pick up the phone and answer, especially if my hands are wet or dirty.BTW, there is another great feature called "Drop In". I like it because my mom can see my daughter anytime, I don't have to run and accept the call. So, Echo Show could be used as baby/security camera, which is really cool. My husband is although very excited about this, as he can see his little cutie anytime when he's on a business trip.I bought only one device because for video calling all I need is an app on a phone and one Echo Show device.The second thing which kinda surprised me was no apps on the screen. I'm not necessarily saying that it is a bad thing, it's just unusual a little bit.I think that Echo show could be irreplaceable for those who have busy hands. Also, it will be a perfect companion for disabled or elderly people, as it would make their life much easier.It doesn't look like a "device from the future" (more like a bulky digital photo frame) but I can definitely put 5 stars here as this is a first step toward the future. And that's pretty amazing.	Tech Insider	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A3GI8NCGDOE2PY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	34	4	2017/06/29
B01J24C0TI	The Amazon Echo Show Finally lets Alexa Show you things	Here is my review of the Echo Show. I have the white version and I love this device. I've been waiting for the show since May 9th. I have all the other Alexa Devices The Tap,Echo and Dot and now the Show. I have the Show in the Kitchen so I can watch videos while I'm cooking or washing dishes. What I love about this device is that Alexa actually shows you video and it's bigger then it looks on a pc. I love the large 7 inch screen. Alexa also has a video phone feature on the show but I doubt I'll be using that.Here is some things I like and don't like.LikeCustomazation. Like with my Samsung Phone I can customize the Show. At the top of the screen pull down and you should see settings or you can ask Alexa to show the settings. From there you can adjust brightness,turn off the clock,stop the default homescreens from rotating etc.Thru the Alexa App you can add your own picture from your phone to use as a theme on the homescreen. Now you can theme your show for every holiday. I use Samsung Themes but any picture on your phone will do. You also have the option to remove the picture and let it go back to the default screens.Being able to view Movies Showtimes and What's Playing in theaters in my area.Watching YouTube Videos and Amazon Prime Videos eg watching videos from my Prime Videolist.Seeing my local weather. Even the theme is updated to show eg if it's raining you'll get a picture of rain or thunderstorms. If the forcast is for rain you'll see a picture with lightning. And I love you can see your 7 day forcast and tell Alexa to scroll.I love seeing the album art,artist and song when I play music from my amazon library or thru prime. Some songs show lyrics but if they don't I think there is a way to ask alexa to show lyrics.Speaker sounds awesome. It's louder then the echos and listen to Kenny Chesney's Live album you feel like your at the concert. Nature recordings sound good as well.The show can do everything the echo can do eg control your lights,thermostats,order you a dominos pizza etc.I like how I can view recipes,my shopping playlist,kitchen timers and so much more. With shopping list you can see everything on your list and ask Alexa to items or add items.Things That Need ImprovementSometimes you won't get a album picture when playing your music. You'll just see a Musical Note in a white square were album art is suppose to be.SiriusXM just shows channel logo. No artist,song or album EA. I was hoping to see everything.ADT Pulse Cameras aren't supported yet so I can't ask Alexa or Adt to show me the back or front porch cameras.Most Flash Briefings don't show video except CNBC. Hopefully more of the news sights will in the future.Screen is a fingerprint magnet get you some screen protectors. There are times you need to touch the screen.Show needs a remote control option so you don't have to touch the screen especially with settings.I see a great future for this device with more developers jumping on the video wagon in updates. Still if you have an Echo or Dot keep them as they can be used in other rooms. Still have my Echo in my bedroom and use it mainly for alarms and music. Show is in kitchen and Dot is in another bedroom. Tap I mainly use when I'm away from home. Granted we will see all kind of Accessories down the road. I can see some skins for the Show you can apply eg to make your show purple,red,blue etc and I can see travel cases being invented to carry the show in.I recommend this device.

B01J24C0TI	It is an awesome device but I have some suggestions that could make ...	Just received my Amazon Echo Show. It is an awesome device but I have some suggestions that could make it better. First of all they need to include my ENTIRE album collection when i ask it to show it and ALL albums by an artist in my album list when I ask for it.. It only a random 6 of them and there are over 2,000. They could easily update it so it does. Also that try this or that screen at the bottom is an eyesore and needs an option to turn it off. You need to go to settings to remove restrictions on youtube video and it should show a list of choices when you ask it to play something, instead it randomly picks one. Other than that, this is an awesome device.	Neil B. Saiontz	Color: White|Configuration: Echo Show	B010CEHQTG	/gp/pdp/profile/A2RA6ZW2BH85H5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	4	2017/06/29
B01J24C0TI	Best Echo Yet! (except for the design)	The setup process for the Echo Show was one of the easiest and fastest I have ever experienced: Just plug it in and enter your Wi-Fi password and Amazon credentials. From there, I could start putting Alexa to work. (If you use third-party services like Spotify, you have to log in to those as well.)The Echo Show’s screen constantly stayed on with a background photo of my choice. It displayed the time while rotating through captions showing future calendar events, the weather and tips on questions I could ask Alexa.Video calling and video playback are the most important features of the Echo Show. After a command like “Alexa, show me how to roast a duck from YouTube,” the screen loaded a list of YouTube videos; each video is numbered, so you could ask Alexa to play a specific clip by naming the number.You could also ask Alexa to place a call to another Echo customer. When I tried it, the Alexa app synchronized with my smartphone’s address book to determine who else was using an Echo. Then just by asking Alexa to call the name of a contact, I could immediately commence a video call.What was also nice about the Echo Show’s being stationary is that it remained fixed on a flattering angle of my face. (If you’re tired of staring up people’s nostrils on FaceTime calls, you’ll know what I mean.)There’s another task that the Echo Show handled better than the Echo speaker: shopping on Amazon. By saying, for example, “Alexa, order me some batteries,” you get the screen to show a list of batteries to choose from. By contrast, with the Echo speaker, the device could only reorder batteries you had bought before — or, if you hadn’t ordered batteries before, choose a pack of batteries for you.For audio, the Echo Show included two small stereo speakers. They sounded loud and clear but lacking in bass. Compared with fancy speakers, the Echo Show sounded average, but it’s adequate for watching YouTube videos in the kitchen or streaming music if you aren’t a nitpicky audiophile.

B01J24C0TI	So far so good	The Echo Show so far has delivered what it promised which is an Alexa with a screen. it has real good sound for a small device. The screen is actually pretty clear. The only thing I would like to see if Amazon could mirror the screen to a tv that would be pretty dope. Also give more touchpad control when searching for youtube or Amazon videos sometimes your voice command won't give the answer you want so typing in the info would actually help.	yerblues86	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A16LKSY3S0BJPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2017/06/29
B01J24C0TI	Maybe I was expecting more...	Initially I gave the Echo Show a 3 star rating. In all fairness after about 20 days of use I've decided to change my score and here's why. First off Amazon reached out to me requesting feed back and advice. I appreciate the concern and their attempts to improve the device. I've also noticed quite a few updates in the short time I've had my Show and honestly things are changing for the better. I've been updating my review and will continue to do so as I've noticed updates and get more hands on experience. After separating my expectations from the actual capabilities of this device I've come to the conclusion that the Show still had me wanting more despite it's capabilities. I currently own the original echo which is in my living room, a dot in my bedroom, and one at work. I have lights, fans, a thermostat, surround sound, and TV all connected to my Alexa devices. Of course I had to buy one with  a screen. I'm a big fan of Alexa, the products have become a routine part of my day. As soon as the Show was available to preorder I ordered one without any hesitation.Initially I wanted to put my show on a 70 inch TV stand by my 60 inch TV where my original Echo was. I figured it wouldn't look bad because I could use it as a digital picture frame also. I don't have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a 7 inch screen from 8 feet away wasn't going to work for me. My Show now sits on my kitchen counter. I figured I'd get more use out of it in my living room because most of my Alexa enabled devices are in there and generally I spend more time in my living room than the kitchen. A few people mentioned why don't you put it on your desk. I honestly don't spend much time in my study, if I am at my desk I'm already on my computer and wanted the Show where I would get the most use out of it.This device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes. My frustration is when I ask it to pull up a recipe it's inconsistent. Sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone, sometimes it wants me to swipe down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients. Why can't I just say Alexa scroll down? Why do I have to touch the screen? Why does it have to send the recipe to my phone for me to view it when the Show already has a screen? As of now I've seen videos with CNN, Reuters, and Fox news during my flash briefings. There was a software update on 7/15/17 and now I've also seen CNBC videos. 7/19/17 I noticed today Bloomberg is now showing videos.You can display a photo, but it doesn't fill the whole screen, it has gray boarders which really make the picture look even smaller on a 7 inch screen and tacky.  The slide show feature can be set through the touch screen. Apparently this depends on how you take your pictures IE cropping and landscaping modes.Personally I think 7 inches is too small to watch a movie from any fixed location unless it was maybe a foot or two from my face so take that in to consideration when determining where you might put one. *Update* Some of Prime's videos are widescreen meaning you only get to use about half of your already small 7 inch screen to watch them. I noticed this while trying to watch 13 Hours Soldiers of Benghazi while I was cooking. This is cellphone size small.Navigating through prime videos can be a chore. You can't say the word movie, you have to say video.  When selecting options by number from the screen you have to be careful with what you say. I said something like play movie one thinking it would understand that the movie with a 1 on it would play. Instead it started playing a song. I had to say Alexa stop. And then go back through the voice navigation to Amazon Prime videos, then find my movie, then ask Alexa to play it.The problem with Youtube it pulls the most popular video that is close to your description based off of key words. It doesn't go to exactly what you are asking it to pull up. Example Alexa show me Donald Trump's latest speech on you tube. It pulled a video from May 2nd which was 2 months ago. This is because the search uses keywords in this scenario Donald Trump and Speech. Then it pulls the most popular or viewed videos.*Update* If you let it sit on the screen selection for a movie for more than a minute it will close out and take you to your home screen. This is frustrating because you have to go all the way back through the voice navigation to get back to Prime, find your movie from a selection of 3 choices per page, ask Alexa to get it to play, and if you say something wrong like Alexa play movie one you'll end up listening to music or being navigated some where else and have to start the process all over again. *Update* There are now voice tips at the bottom of the screen to help you navigate.One thing I love about my dots and the original Alexa devices is that they are intuitive I don't have to use precise wording. My Show expects me to use precise wording to navigate and use quite a bit of features. I just left the kitchen trying to get it to go to the dim screen. I used multiple variations of turn off the screen which sometimes works.I kept getting the response sorry what device? After several attempts to get this command to work I gave up and walked out of the kitchen frustrated. Maybe it's still learning from me? *Update*  I am still having issues with it not always recognizing the turn off the screen command.I also find myself constantly having to ask the Show to turn the screen off. I don't know why it keeps turning on without me using any wake words. I heard it wake when my dogs went in to the kitchen this morning 7/19/17, yet I can walk past it all day long and it doesn't wake.The show does everything you've come to love with your original echo devices, despite it's beautiful display, you'll still feel like you need a larger screen. If it was an option I'd buy one with a 10 inch screen.The sound is hands down better than any other Alexa device. The show can put out some bass. For some reason when playing Prime movies any speech sounds a bit muffled and the sound output is significantly lower..I placed an order with my Show and honestly it was fast and unlike my other Echos I could visually verify my order. I didn't have to pull my phone out, fumble with a keyboard, computer or tablet. I knew what I wanted said the name and probably in less than 30 seconds placed my order. I thought the drop in feature would be good to check in on my dogs but the camera sits high, with the Show now sitting on my kitchen counter that's not going to work. If you want to use the Show to drop in on your dogs it would have to be a foot off the ground. With just a handful of family members using the Alexa devices the video chat probably isn't going to be used much.Being able to look at my lists calendar and reminders without having to pull my phone out is nice. I wish the calendar could show more than just one day at a time. Like my whole week or month. The show won't display your whole shopping list only 3 to 4 items on the screen at one time then you have to ask it to scroll down. *Update* As of 7/16/17 the Show displays 2 days on the calendar now and will scroll through events two at a time.If you are a shopper like me that likes to browse recommendations your show will only give you a total of 12 recommendations which were no where near as accurate as my interests on my Amazon account usually are, actually they were way off. You can only view one product at a time. Basically the Show is only good for ordering when you know exactly what you want. It's not good with recommendations, and browsing items. You are limited to viewing items one at a time and then having to ask Alexa to scroll right or go right makes the process painfully slow. I guess the best way to explain the show. Most of what the Alexa devices were using your phone for can now be done on the show's touch screen. I still find myself listening to my Show more than looking at it, which kind of defeats the purpose of a screen. My biggest frustration with the Show is instead of operating Alexa from across the room with voice commands I find myself having to stand in front of it, or walk to it then hovering over it to navigate through the screens. I still find myself pulling my phone out of my pocket or reaching for a tablet to pull up information rather than getting up walking to the device and dealing with the frustratingly clunky voice navigation. Most of everything we use now a days is wireless, we aren't used to being restricted to a certain area to use a device. I haven't felt this way since the landline was the only way to make a call and there were no such things as laptops, tablets, bluetooth, smartphones and other smart devices.*Update* I attempted to use the video chat today to call my Dad. He answered with his dot so I could not see him. I thought he might answer from his phone so we could test it. The Show gives you a full screen view of yourself before the call is connected and a smaller window like Skype once the call is connected. With the angle of the camera and my Show sitting on the kitchen counter I had to take a few steps back, maybe 5 feet from the device so that my head would show up on the camera. As a note I am 6" 2. When my Dad answered we could not understand each other because of a bad connection. I ended the call quickly and called him from my cell. I have a 60 mbps connection and he uses FIOs.Why you might consider buying the Fire7 tablet before the buying the Echo ShowI bought the Fire 7 tablet with Alexa for $30.00 during Prime day, now $49.99 (Same price as a Dot!) Here are some noteworthy comparisons. The show is limited to being plugged in to a wall and although it can be easily moved it will require a little planning as to where you might put one. The Fire 7 is obviously portable and has none of these restrictions. Both have a 7-inch, 1024 x 600 touchscreen. The Show blows the Fire 7's speakers out of the water. However you can use bluetooth with the tablet and compensate for the lack of sound quality on your device. In order to use Alexa on the tablet you have to hold down the home key for a few seconds then without using the wake word Alexa or Echo speak your command. This is a nice feature because it won't wake my other Echo devices, it will also give those worried about the always listening peace of mind. Plus it's one less thing to have to say in your list of commands. I found my tablet very responsive to my commands and could do ALMOST everything my Dot and Original Echo can do EXCEPT you can not use the newly enabled voice call feature, which to me is no big deal. Apparently you can not set reminders on the Fire 7. All of my home smart devices can be controlled from my tablet by giving the same commands I use on my other Echo devices. You can not use the Show's video chat feature. Skype, Oovoo and a few other apps are options you can take advantage of. The Echo show when it displays cards and information the whole screen is filled, where as the Fire 7 you loose about 10% of the same image that is on the Show. However unlike the Show you can rotate your screen. For those that complained about the lack of HDMI output on the Show you can pick up a micro USB to HDMI adapter with the Fire 7 tablet and fix that complaint. For those that complained there was no way to cast to your TV with the Show and other Echo devices you can cast your Prime movies straight from your Fire 7 to your Firestick or Fire TV. You can access your tablet's apps via Alexa with the Fire 7, The Show has no apps. The fire 7 also syncs instantly with your other devices in Amazon's ecosystem. I find myself using my Fire7 significantly more than my Show. I don't have to be in the kitchen hovering over my counter and lets just face it even a limited Amazon tablet can do a lot more than an Echo device with a screen. Think of the Fire 7 as the budget friendly tap version of the show for $80.00 less than a tap and $180.00 less than a Show. If you are on the fence about shelling out $230.00 but want to experience the Echo screen hype this may be the way to go.

B01J24C0TI	Good but not great	I expected more from the new Echo show. The screen looks great but the device overall felt bulky to me.It's easy to setup and takes you through some of the features it offers. However once done I realized that the additional features are not really all that useful to me. Video calling and watching shows on the Show was as useful as it was going to get for me and both felt a little cluncky to me.

B01J24C0TI	Pretty good, but rough around the edges.	I've spent the last two days with the Echo Show, and am really happy with it. I know it'll get better as time goes on, but it's a bit rough around the edges right now.* Show to Show calling is quite nice - calling across the house and to my friend's house was done flawlessly. The video was at the quality of our Skype and Facetime conversations. But backlit rooms? Forget it - it's hard to see the other person (or for them to see you.)* The display is quite nice and playing videos from Amazon Video was easy but a bit awkward. The screen is as good as the entry level Fire tablet.* Having said that, there's no skills/apps that take advantage of the screen quite yet, so it's nice to look at but not really functional quite yet. I can show my photos from my Amazon account, and manually set wallpaper from the app on the phone, but the out of box experience might let you down.* The Alexa implementation for right now is a bit weak. For example, I can't say "Alexa, play The Americans" without it going to search for music. Same with looking up Youtube. That was a bit rough.* The speakers are amazing - I was kind of surprised at how good the quality was when playing music at full volume (sorry, neighbors) with no real distortion. It's no Bose speaker but it works.* Getting this to work as my bedside alarm clock is easy - you can say "do not disturb" when you're ready for bed, and you have to set the "do not disturb" time from the app if you want it scheduled.* There is a lot of nostalgia, especially if you had a Chumby or a Sony Dash.* There's no USB ports, so you can't use this to charge your phone. Makes sense.Overall I like it - this will take the place of the bedside Echo Dot while that gets repurposed around the house. For right now, this is a fancier version of the Dot, but it will improve over time as developers take advantage of the screen, and feedback steers the development from Amazon's side. Come the holidays, this should magnitudes better. For right now, 3.5 stars.

B01J24C0TI	A great addition to the Echo family!	I bought two of the Shows -- one for my daughter, one for me. It was very easy to set up, quickly letting me begin using it. I was surprised by its weight (substantial) and by its size. Even though Amazon has provided plenty of photos showing the Show in relation to other objects, it just didn't register with me that it would be as big as it is. For that reason, I'm posting two photos to show it beside other items in a typical kitchen (which is where mine is) so its easy to visualize the size.The screen is always lighted, but if you want to keep it in the bedroom, just say "Alexa, turn off your screen," and it'll go black with just a faded display of the time -- not enough light to interrupt sleep. The next time you use the wake word, the screen comes alive again. The quality of the display is impressive. The screen cycles through an array of displays urging you to interact with the Show. It gives you suggestions of things to try and displays some interesting facts and news items. I'm old school, so this is the first time I've set up a personal calendar. I've entered my upcoming appointments and I like that the cycling screens display the appointments from time to time -- helping me keep them top-o'-mind.The Show offers hands-free, video calling and messaging that's both a big convenience and a lot of fun. Speaking of videos, the cycling displays also offer videos that you can tell Alexa to play. The videos have striking clarity and quality. Viewing is comfortable and clear from several feet away. Another feature I like is that you can ask Alexa what movies are playing nearby and up pops "posters" for several. Alexa will play the trailers for you, if you ask her to.I've seen some reviews that raise objections to the Show grabbing all the contacts from your phone. I find that mysterious. All it took from my phone was my number and my daughter's. I set that up before getting the Show when I wanted to try calling/messaging with the original Echo. Maybe I did something to keep the Echo from grabbing all my contacts, but if so, I don't recall what it was.If you're on the fence, go ahead and order the Show. I'll bet you'll love it. If not, you can return it thanks to Amazon's generous return policy.

Sound Quality is simply amazing! Better than the original Echo even!3.) Easy setup! Setup is even easier than previous Alexa devices due to the screen! - No phone or computer browser required!!4.) Nice sharp VIVID screen! Bright and Excellent colors5.) Video Flash Briefing is very cool and has several different sources that you can choose from6.) Shows music Lyrics7.) Works very well with my Wink system and smarthome devices! Alexa has always worked well with them and still does8.) Can hear me very well and responds to my commands9.) Video calls work well and if you have two of these in the same house it can work as sort of an intercom system if setup correctly. That's super nice!  It would be nice if video calls take off like Skype or FaceTime, but that will probably never happen and if it does, it will take a while.Cons1.) Not compatible with many home cameras yet.. Hopefully YI and a few other popular cameras will become compatible with Echo Show2.) I was hoping to use this as an alarm clock but the screen is very bright.. they need to make a sleep or alarm mode.. Saying "Do Not Disturb" helps a little, but a full alarm clock mode with very dim screen would make this almost perfect3.) Not a lot of skills that use the screen yet.. for example, a newer Alexa skill is Sirius XM.. All my other SiriusXM devices at least show artist name and song, some show album art even.. The echo show just shows "SiriusXM" and nothing else.. I know developers will soon use the screen better but just know for now, the screens functions are limitedOverall I am very happy with my show and will be using it more over the weekend!

B01J24C0TI	Great Device, Dodgy Privacy Issues	THE GRRRRREAT:  This is a great device, with one major privacy flaw (see THE BAD below). I've had a Sony Dash on my nightstand for years, showing me weather, time, and other things in an incredibly well-designed display (color, layout, diming at night, etc.). Sony just discontinued functionality in June 2017, so I was looking for a replacement. Just as I started my search, I mean that afternoon, presto, Amazon read my mind with a device that is about the same size and form as a Dash, but with better functionality. I love the ability of the Echo Show to play Pandora, play Amazon Prime movies, check weather, etc. And hands-free voice calling from Echo to Echo is wonderful in all ways (ease, clarity, etc.). Great job with the device Amazon!THE BAD: The main downside is the way it handles contacts, and therefore your privacy and ability to call (voice or video) with folks. In short, the Alexa App builds your contact list for this device my matching contacts from your phone with folks who also own an Echo, and it shows you them as a contact on your contact list. Unfortunately, it means it is also showing you on these folks' contact list, whether you want this or not. And you cannot edit your contact list, only block callers. What a privacy issue and awful decision by someone at Amazon! I have a number of friends who are inclined to buy this device but will NOT until this privacy issue is fixed. Fix it now, AMAZON! Then everyone will give the Echo Show 5 stars and you'll sell millions a week. If as a buyer the privacy issue does not bother you, you should buy this great device. It's wonderfully done!

B01J24C0TI	Power 3 watts sleep, 5 when idle, and 7-10 when playing music. Annoying that home screen doesn't have more customization	First of all, this is a cutting edge device that still has a way to go. The biggest downside is the lack of customization on the screen. It has a clock and lots of custom potential (anything amazon wants to put up there) but I am not all that excited about only seeing what Amazon wants me to see. So I am hoping that in the near term, Amazon will allow better customization options for the screen.Mainly 2 things:1. My own text feed, like news, or stocks, or a set of pictures ...2. More control over how fast it goes to sleep and how big the clock is after it sleeps, etc ...I also thought a lot about how much power this device will use since it is on all the time. So I connected the Echo Show up to my Belkin insight power monitor.  It ranged a little but basically it pulled :3 watts: In "sleep mode" dark screen with time that moves around slowly5 watts: When on and regular display7-8 watts: playing mid range volume music that is streaming10-11 watts : full volume streaming musicMy router was 10 feet away so this may impact idle levels if your wifi is weak.Overall it has worked fine and I set my 2 units 1 downstairs and 1 upstairs. After I named them something simple like Kitchen and Bedroom (in the Alexa app) I was able to just say "call kitchen" and it would work just like an intercom. That was cool.Other than the limited home screen functions and the promise for more, this is at its core an Echo with a decent but not great 7 inch screen.I also have a Ring Doorbell and it connected up pretty quickly and in a few minutes I asked Alexa to show me the front door and after a bit of a delay, it showed the ring video. All of this was very handy and I am hoping that with some optimizations, it will be a lot quicker. It seemed to take a while (a few seconds) to show the door.

B01J24C0TI	Slightly bigger sound, more responsive, a screen to provide extra data and it remains fully accessible to blind users.	I was delighted with my earlier Amazon Echo devices but purchase this one in hopes of bigger sound. I will admit the sound is bigger but not as much as I had hoped. I am very happy with this device overall as it offers more responsiveness, a screen for some extra data, and the reliability I've come to expect from the Echo lineup.  As a side note, blind users will find this device is accessible as it has a built in screen reader you can enable  and  that screen reader works very well including the tutorial that gets you started with it . .Areas for improvement include:1. Drop-in and calling audio quality in general should be better. I'm using Apple Facetime as my reference. This unit sounds more like Skype with that slightly garbled sound.2. I hope Ring Pro support improves. It takes too long to connect to camera, no ability to chat with the door as the call is listen only plus you cannot answer the door when it rings which seems correctable and I hope they do it.

B01J24C0TI	It's Ok. But doesn't seem to be a way ...	It's Ok. But doesn't seem to be a way to tell it to turn its screen off. Using "Alexa, turn off screen", it responds with "Sorry, I don't know screen."As a follow up, after quite a bit of web searching, the missing word is "your". So, "Alexa turn off YOUR screen" works. The time is still displayed in a low level light. However, after using Alexa to control Hue lights, this phrase doesn't always work. Alexa responds with "What device"? After a bit of time the command sometimes works.On a different search topic "chicken recipes", it came up with ham and potato soup because it used 2 tbsp of dried chicken bullion. No way to print except to send to my phone as a text message.	Alan Suding	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A38IE6LVA4181P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	3	2017/06/29
B01J24C0TI	The show literally takes Alexa to whole new level.	 So far we love the Echo Show.  We wanted the intercom (drop in) feature.  I don't automatically update my mobile apps and thus it would not work.  Low and behold after the update it worked, but I had to do a Google search to figure it out.  It also works on the echo and dot as well, which i did not know when i bought these.  I am still happy with them (day 1).  I would suggest starting by adjusting your settings to "only my household" for drop in until you understand how it works.  But I must admit I do like the screen and the speaker is plenty loud!.  I did however buy camera privacy slides to appease my wife.  The show literally takes Alexa to whole new level.

B01J24C0TI	Data Grab - Trojan Horse	Trojan horse.  In order to use the video calling functionality, you are required to sync your ENTIRE cell phone contact list.  There is literally no way to manually add just one or two addresses of family members or others.  It seems like this would have been quite simple to allow, as Skype etc allow this, and so the only conclusion here is that Amazon is after the data so it can create massive database for its own purposes.  But at least you get to pay them to give them your personal data for free.

B01J24C0TI	A Great Addition to the Echo Family - Love It	I have multiple Echos (3 originals, several Dots and one Tap).  Given this is a first generation Show, it performs extremely well.- It is super easy to set up.  Turn it on. Follow the on-screen instructions.  Connect it to your Wi-Fi.  Download updates and it is up and running.  It is the easiest device I have ever set up.  It connected instantly to my 5Ghz network and I have had zero connection problems.- All of the normal Echo functions work, but now you have video.  You can watch your timer(s) tick down; see business hours, addresses, phone numbers, etc. for businesses; watch the lyrics to songs as the play; see the 7 day weather forecast; read recipes; etc.- The screen is nice and bright and, for its size, very clear.  Not super HD, but good enough.- The touchscreen works very well.-The video calling work very well.- Streaming video works great.- Audible audiobooks play great.- The speakers are very good - far far better than the DOT and noticeably better than the original Echo.- I like the appearance.  I purchased 2 white Shows (despite the fact the Verified shows as purchasing black).  The one I set up in the kitchen blends well with my white counter surface.- Works perfectly with my TP-Link smarthome light swtiches.- The screen can be turned off so that it is completely black.  This is done in the dropdown menu under settings.- I set one of my photos as the home screen.  Again, use the settings menu.- Echo just keeps getting better and better, and this is a big advance.The Show is a great addition to the Echo family.  It does not replace the DOTs that I have hooked up to my various speakers via cable, which I prefer over Bluetooth.  Perhaps in the future it will, but the DOT is unobtrusive and relatively inexpensive so I do not care.  It could replace the original Echo, but does take up a bit more surface.  I am having a lot of fun with this.  I have had it up and running for only 24 hours so I have many other new things to try.

B01J24C0TI	Not ready for prime time. No really.	If there were a way to give this negative stars I'd do it. Amazon, seriously. I don't understand you guys. Half the time you do great things and the other half the time I frankly at am a loss for words. Do you do ANY testing at all before you go to market? Seriously, who decided this was ready to be sold as is.Me: Alexa show my videosEcho: Here are your photos.Me: Alexa show me my movies.Echo: here are your videos. ( I asked for videos and got photos. I have for movies and it gives me my videos. )but then it only shows me about 20 of my more than 100 movie Library.Me: Alexa, show me a calendarEcho: here is what's on the calendar. (no, I want to see a calendar month for this month)I tried everything. There is no calendar. If I wanted to see events, I'd ask to see events. See how that is logical? I want to see a calendar. It's not rocket science. It's that basic thing that hangs on everyone's wall? You know a 30 day calendar?So I begin to think maybe this isn't my account...Me: Alexa, who's account is this.Echo: This device has only one account, Alex's.A last name would be good here. Lot's of Alex's out there.Me: Alex's show me what's on prime videoEcho: YouTube plays something I have no idea what it is.I can't ask what's on prime video. It has no concept of what I am asking. And this just goes on and on. Stick with me Amazon. I have an idea. You have a video based Echo. Maybe, just maybe, it would be a good idea that we could ask this video based echo what new movies are on prime video??  Yah think? I eventually got it to show me some prime movies. It seems to pick 20 to show as a selection. Kind of like when it showed me a selection of 20 of my movie library even though I have well over a hundred.Me: Alexa, show songs from my library.Echo: this shows 50 random songs from my library.Me: Alexa, show albums in my library.Echo: this shows 50 albums. Better than the response I got from my movies query.Here are some request to make this living disaster better.Me: Alexa, show me my video collection.This should result in showing me movies and tv shows I own and/or have rented. I should be able to choose movies from here.once in movies, I should be able to search for a movie by name from this point.Me: Alexa, show me a calendar.This should result in showing me a calendar for the current month, with Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun across the top and all the numbers of the weeks below. I ought to be able to then say, what's going on for the 14th. And it should be the 14th. I should be able to say, add event for the 14th and then add the event. I know, rocket science, right?Me: Alexa, show me holidays for this month.The result, I think you know...If I ask to see my shopping list it says I have one item "1 Song" if I ask it to show me 1 or song or both it fails to understand what I am talking about.Bottom line, this is JUST NOT FINISHED. Not by a country mile. You have to be kidding me if you think this is ready for the end user.

B01J24C0TI	Not Recommended	Update: I'm returning the device as there is still no way to turn off the text ("suggestions") and my 30 days id's almost up. Never buy version 1 of anything. If they fix it I might repurchase.Device is OK but the home screen is cluttered and busy with text that you can't turn off.  If you want to display your photos they can barely be seen because of the time, temperature and the text.  If you turn off the trending topics you get an endless stream of Alexa tips but there's no way to turn off the text.  Maybe they should test the O/S before releasing it to the public.  I saw the flaw right out of the box, called tech support and listened for 30 minutes while the rep guessed at ways to turn off the text none of which worked.  I asked for a supervisor and was finally told that you can't turn off the text.

B01J24C0TI	Some critical flaws	I loved this out of the box. The screen was crisp, and everything seemed to work OK, although I had issues getting my Phillips Hue to connect. However, there are some major issue that will likely have me returning it. The first, and most concerning, is that the camera is always on, and if you turn it off, it disables the motion sensing, so the screen always stays dim. The last thing I want on my nightstand is an internet-linked camera that could possibly be hacked. The second issue is the screen brightness. Even at the lowest setting, the screen is very bright. It lights up my bedroom. Amazon is marketing this as something you can put on your nightstand, so it's baffling that they didn't consider people wouldn't want a bright beacon on their nightstand all night. Finally, the last major flaw (or should I say irritant) is the constant clutter of "tips" scrolling across the bottom of the screen. I thought these would stop after a while, but they are a constant. I was really excited about a screen-enabled Echo, but I've gone back to the non-screen version. Also, one additional issue, while not a deal breaker, is the sound. It just doesn't sound quite as good as the original Echo, probably because the original has omni-directional speakers.	W.

B01J24C0TI	Great product - could use some improvements	Easy to setup and so far I am liking it a lot.  I'm a little surprised that I can't use it to do things like ring my phone without a 3rd party app or place calls through my phone.  My biggest issue so far though is that my Outlook work calendar displays events on the screen but when I ask it to open my calendar or tell me about events, it always says it's having a problem accessing it which is really annoying.I'm hoping there are some improvements soon.Other than that it's pretty good.I am in the process of setting up my home automation stuff which should make it even more useful.

B01J24C0TI	The perfect upgrade from the Echo and Echo Dot.  Stylish, crystal clear visuals and sound!	 The Echo Show at its base is thicker than I imagined - a feature I’m grateful for. I almost hesitated to buy it for fear that it was going to be thin with a flat stand at its base inviting my cats to knock it over, but this design makes that impossible.All that it comes with is a plug and directions leaving the task of instructing us to the device itself. Everything was smooth as silk, the update took about 10 minutes. The screen is crystal clear and is a touch screen so entering passwords or other settings is a matter of touching what you need. The Echo Show creates its own rotating screen saver with gentle and constant reminders of what you can do with it intermixed with a few headlines that you can follow through by saying the command that is shown on the screen.I wasn’t sure how different the experience of Echo Show would be from my “normal Echo” so I tried a few commands. What’s really intriguing is that you are shown things you may not have expected. Like The weather changed the screen to illustrate the forecast.  I'm still having trouble getting say the CNN Video News to show up --- I keep getting my "Flash Briefing" but it's literally just semantics. I just watched Moonlight on it, the picture is perfect (it didn't respond to the "turn closed captions on" command but I figure those are minor bugs that I can learn to set up).  The sound is remarkable and there are constant hints in the form of screen savers that are actually more helpful than I would have imagined.  Like it just told me to ask Alexa about a headline that had just popped on the screen and a video appears.It also shows lyrics to your music if you command it to and it turns them off just as easily. The lyrics are spot on and appear in sync with the singer...so you know where they are and you could karaoke provided that you were alone and not ruining the song for anyone.The feeling I get is that this is just going to get better with time. I'm already used to calling out Alexa commands so this is a no-brainer. I am looking for a good stand for mine so it can be elevated just a bit to enjoy the array of messages. I haven't called anyone yet because no one I know has this hooked up.  But that is going to change, today!  (As I type this the screen says "ask Alexa to Auto Tune" ... OMG, the 'woman is a trip.  lol).it's fun, high-tech and completely entertaining - that's a lot!

You now have a platform to showcase all those endearing ads you can at least pay extra to opt out of on your other Amazon devices - things you aren't interested at all in run across your home screen 24/7 because the screen won't dim and you can't turn it off. With this version of Echo it seems Big Brother really has invaded and it wants your money, I like the Echo dots, really like the speaker version- but this one is not customizable in a friendly way and I find it creepy!

We were among the first Echo buyers when it came out and we love it!  Picked them up in Lynden, Washington today as I live in British Columbia.  Set the 2 of them up within minutes. Very simple to do. We wanted the video intercom feature in particular and I love it as it works super well.  There is a bit of an echo sound to it but not enough to be a problem.  I love the camera to snap photos, love the ability to have my photos displayed sequentially if I so desire, love the lyrics of songs being displayed, love the sound quality.  Haven't found anything yet that I don't like.  Absolutely love it and I am enjoying learning all the things it will do. Wish I was in the States so I could use all the features.  Buy one you will love it.	laurel	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/AR9RVJ0BOHLVJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	5	2017/06/29

B01J24C0TI	I'm in love with the Amazon Show.	I've have Fire TV, also Fire Stick,  Fire Phone. I have the first Amazon Echo, the Tap, and the Dot. As a long time prime member I've been apart of the Amazon since it was ordering books on line. Lol many years. I preordered the Amazon Show, and received on the 28, June. WOW!! Amazing. If you love the Amazon Echo products, your going to be in heaven with this one. The screen is as good as my 4k, the sound is amazing for the size. I was really surprised on that. The Ads, and videos you have seen on this product don't come close I think, to what it can do. I can do all by voice. Can see my timers, Lists, Calendar, Music, Movies in prime or own in Amazon. YouTube videos as well. Look up recipes and it stays up on screen while making. I've had it Amazon Show two days, I don't want to be without it. I think they hit this one out of the park. It will Bluetooth to headphones, or bigger Bluetooth speakers if you want. But it sounds great. There's good Dolby speakers in this, it has good depth to them. I have mine in Kithen/Livingroom. If you use any of your echoes often, your going to a whole new level I think with this. This Amazon Show is touch screen as well as all voice. I would of give this more stars if I could. If your on the fence don't be. I've done calling and texting with this. It works great and so easy if your busy in the kitchen to answer calls by voice. Who calls you has to have the Amazon Show, or Alexa app on smart device. You can voice text app, Echo or the Show.  I don't write a lot of reviews unless I really love the product. And I've paid for all my products, and get nothing for writing this review.One more thing. Need Wifi for this product, but this was the easiest to set up of any of the Amazon products I think. This is so worth the money, and something I think you don't know how you did without.

B01J24C0TI	Bypassed the competition with this product	Much greater improvement over the Dot and Alexa. It may not be the most modern looking, but it's unique. I know it's going to continue to go up hill from here in terms of what this device can do... I can't wait!

B01J24C0TI	Love the new Echo Show!	I have been happily anticipating the arrival of my new Echo Show. I currently own the original Echo and an Echo Dot and absolutely love them both.The Echo Show arrived nicely packaged and my first impression is that it is a clean looking design and a bit smaller than I had pictured in my mind, but that is not necessarily a bad thing, as it looks great on my counter top. It is EXTREMELY easy to set up due to the touch screen. No need to consult the Alexa app. I only needed to know the name of my Wifi, wifi password and Amazon password. This was a truly simple process and the touch screen walks you through it. It needed to update before starting, which I found odd since it was literally released today, but it only took a few minutes and we were up and running. I guess this is just an example of how Amazon is constantly updating and improving these devices.The home screen displays the time and I set it up to scroll through family pictures which I really enjoy. If you own a Kindle Fire, this has a similar pull down from the top menu to give access to your settings.I began asking Alexa questions immediately. "Alexa, how old is Tom Brady?" I got a nice picture of the golden boy along with his age which is definitely a plus. The questions are answered aloud as well as with text on the screen. You can set up a Flash Briefing using the Alexa App on your phone to tell you the news whenever you ask. CNN provided a nice video with their news which was really cool, but NPR and Wall Street Journal just had audio. I was a bit disappointed that the majority of the skills I tried did not utilize the screen. I think that just like the original Echo, this will improve with time. These are skills (apps) so it is just a matter of the skill updating to adjust to the new technology. Amazon is also great at listening to feedback and adding more features all the time. Echo Show is able to list movie times and even show movie trailers on the screen. The picture quality is very good. I also ask sports questions and the team logo, scores and information are displayed on the screen along with the answer to my question. I'm a big college sports fan and I love asking when the next game is or the score of the last game. This is a great feature.Now, what I use my Echo for the most...playing music. I am an Amazon Prime member so have access to the Prime music library. You can also use Pandora, Sirius, Spotify, Iheart radio and TuneIn. "Alexa, play Zach Brown Band."  I am amazed at the rich, full sound that fills the large kitchen/family and dining room in our open floor plan house. I am not an expert on speakers but the sound is definitely better than the original Echo which I still very much enjoy. The screen shows the lyrics so feel free to sing along!One thing that I find myself saying over and over is "Alexa go home." This seems to be the easiest way to close a skill or video and return to your home screen. You can also scroll down from the top of the screen to get your settings bar and touch the home button.YouTube is the bomb on this device. It is fully functional and will prove to be both entertaining and educational. I love this feature. "Alexa, show me a YouTube video on dog training." Boom! I have many choices available to me on the screen.  "Alexa, play number 2." Now, if I could only get Alexa to train my dog to stop putting her front paws up on the kitchen counter...I also tried the Ted Talks app and that provided audio only.Echo Show reads Audible books very well, the same as the original Echo but with the better speakers. There is not much benefit to having a screen for this, but I listen to Audible a lot while working in the kitchen or making dinner.I tested the Amazon video capabilities and was very pleased with its ability to provide that content. Since I have it on the kitchen counter, i don't plan to watch movies on the Echo Show, but certainly could if I wanted. I can unplug it and move it anywhere I would like and it quickly connects itself to Wifi once plugged in again.I looked up a recipe on the AllRecipe skill and was pleased that it showed a picture of the dish and written ingredient list along with directions on the screen. This will be quite helpful. When I played music at the same time I was looking at the recipe, it would go back to the music lyric screen after a few minutes. I would have preferred it to stay on my recipe. I will need to explore this further. It could be user error. The Campbells recipe skill does not currently provide any content on the Echo screen but sends the recipe via email to another device. I would think this can/should be improved.If you have a timer set, it is displayed on the screen. This also reverts back to the lyric screen if you are playing music, but I don't mind that as you can always ask, "Alexa, how much time is left?" and she will tell you. I just love her! The timer still goes off even with the music on.I have had this less than 24 hours but am really enjoying it. It is more user friendly than the original Echo because it is continually providing help and information on the touch screen. Even if you are technically challenged, you should be able to use this.All of the Echo devices are great for running smart home devices, but I don't currently use it for that, so can't really help you there.You can also make video calls with this, which I have not yet tried. I'm usually walking around and doing other things while talking on the phone so probably won't use this feature much. It would be great if you had children or grandchildren you wanted to see when you were out of town.In my opinion, the Echo Show is a helpful, innovative and fun gadget to own. It needs to improve a bit to fully utilize the display screen which I believe it will with time. If you currently do not have any Echo devices, then this is the one to get. If you are a bit uncomfortable with technology, then this would be a good device for you because Amazon provides so much support via the touch screen. If you already own the original Echo, you may or may not want to purchase this right now. I have not found it to be worlds better than my original Echo at this point. If you would use the video chat or are wanting a richer sound for music, then I recommend purchasing the Echo Show. I do enjoy now having an Echo in the kitchen/main part of the house and in the bedroom. I am hoping that, like the original Echo, the content will continue to improve with time, but I am very happy with my purchase of the Echo Show. I hope this helped you!

B01J24C0TI	Alexa Needs a Face	The Show just may be my favorite Echo product yet. I unpacked it just under 24 hours ago, and had the day off to get acquainted with it. The speaker system is just as good as the original Echo, plus on many tracks, synced lyrics are shown. Stories span the screen throughout the day, and you have the option to tap the screen to see a video of the story. The first one I saw was of a spider casting a 50 foot web.The time is displayed unless you're in the middle of another task, so when I'm in the room with the show, I don't have to ask the time. The screen also gives real time outdoor temperature. Some Networks offer a video option to the Flash Briefing. Also today, I discovered that my favorite News Network, OANN, has an app that allows me to listen to their Newscast live, which is great.I have yet to try making or receiving video calls, as it appears none of my contacts have even the Alexa APP. The home screen has a scrolling wallpaper effect, and you can also customize it. I've got a lot of discovering to do yet with the Show, but it is a welcome edition to my collection of Alexa Enabled Devices.Only suggestion I have so far would be that, given the Show does have a screen and a motion sensor, Alexa be given a virtual face for active conversations. I'm no programmer, but with the sensor, Alexa should even be able to follow the user, turning her head as whoever is talking to her moves....One week later... The Echo Show has yet to disappoint. Over the past few days I've had the opportunity to try the Video Calling and Drop-in features. They work great, and it was pretty cool to be away from home and drop-in on my Echo Show, seeing that all was just as I had left it. Now I just need to convince other people I know to al least install the Alexa App. The coolest part is that as long as you have Wi-Fi, your phone doesn't need to have a service plan, as calls are placed via the Alexa App. I installed a Google Voice # on an old phone of mine, installed the Alexa App under a separate Amazon account, and am now able to make calls with that phone to and from my current phone and Echo devices. Going back to the Drop-In feature now, I believe a great addition to that would be what I consider a "Show-Me" feature. Using "Show-Me" would enable the user to access the camera-feed of the Echo Show from their phone or another Echo Show, without the screen waking up. Renters have to deal with Landlords who sometimes allow their workers into the premises unbeknownst to  the renter. The ability to watch your home, without someone who lives there knowing you are watching, via your Echo Show through your Smart phone, would be awesome.A few other features I have stumbled across are that, beyond the camera/mic off button, the camera can be turned off separately using the "Do Not Disturb" feature. Either ask Alexa, use the pull down menu on-screen, or use the Alexa App to accomplish this. While "Do Not Disturb" is active, the "Drop-In" feature is disabled. Also, tell Alexa to "Turn off your screen" will stop the advertisements from scrolling across the screen and leave only a clock, which moves every few minutes. The illumination of the clock is controlled via the bright/dim feature on the pull down menu.2nd Edit: Going back to the "Show Me" feature that I think would be quite helpful (not that I'd expect that's what it would be called), it seems that since the Echo Show does have a motion sensor, that would be quite useful in a private Drop-In security feature. Assuming there is no one home, and no pets are in the house, one should theoretically be able to set an alert, based on the motion sensor, that will instantly notify the Smart phone of the primary user, or any household member selected, that something is happening that should not be. That notification, once received, could allow the respondent to give their Smart phone a command such as "Alexa, Show Me", and immediately see what is happening while the Show remains silent, while in no way alerting any potential intruder, except perhaps, Alexa's eventual face staring them down. Then, if needed, the user could call the police and give the intruder a welcoming farewell surprise. The Echo Show could potentially be the perfect silent alarm, giving one the option to see what's happening before the police are called for what could possibly be no reason at all. Makes me wish computer programming made any sense whatsoever to me.Something else I recently discovered is that while the Alexa App on your Smart phone will import any contacts who also have the Alexa App on their Smart phone, you do have the option of blocking any of them whom you do not wish to communicate with via the Alexa App. The App is also helpful in giving yourself a reminder when get home. Just send yourself a text or voice message through the App if you have something you may need to take care of but may forget otherwise. The yellow lights will be active on the Echo, and the Show will have the number of messages illuminated in the conversation symbol.	tLeander7	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A3T011GYG597CW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	17	5	2017/06/29

B01J24C0TI	Excellent addition to Alexa echo, or as a new stand alone device.	I ordered a pair yesterday, received today by Noon.Having been a long term "Alexa" user, it did not take me long to get myself familiarized with the Echo Show. It's like a regular Echo, except with a screen so you can watch movies, see trailers, and make video calls, etc.... I like the sleek design in black, and the set up with auto update took under 5 minutes.Very nice addition to already established Echo owners, or first time Echo adventurers . No doubt this thing will add more skills, and features later. I enjoy asking Alexa to show me the outside cameras linked to Echo, so I won't have to see it on my phone. Just ask, and the Show will deliver.Smart home control, and integration. I works great with Control-4 that and with my Mobilinc HD  smart home controlled devices.Price is a bit steep. , could be lower. I am sure I'll be adding more Echo Shows if they go on sale.Buy it, you will enjoy this new gadget.

B01J24C0TI	Best Echo available!	The Amazon Echo Show is a voice-activated device. You can instruct it to play video content, play music, stream online audio, order products and services, and control home automation products. The Echo Show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen, which in my opinion, greatly enhances the use and potential of this device.I’ve been using this device for a few days so far. Below you will find some of my initial impressions:### What I Like ######Good build quality: The Show has a nice, bright screen that has good viewing angles.Good sound: The speakers on the Show sound much better than the original echo.Easy setup: Setup was extremely easy, mostly due to the Show’s touch screen. After making a few selections, the Show was up and running in no time.Content suggestions: When you aren't interacting with the Show, it continuously displays content suggestions. I like that it will suggest videos to watch.Video content: I like being able to view Amazon Video, video news briefings, movie trailers, and YouTube videos on the Show.Video calling: Video calling works as advertised. I like being able to initiate a call with my voice.Music with lyrics: When playing songs from Amazon Music, you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen.Home automation: Like other Echos, the Show can control your smart home products. The show has the extra ability to display camera feeds.On-screen apps: The echo can display my calendar, reminders, lists, timers, local weather, and more. Because of this, I find the Show infinitely more useful than the original Echo.### What I Don't Like ######The Show needs more functionality that leverages the touch screen. I trust that new skills will be added over time but I'm disappointed that more wasn't available at launch.The Show should have an audio-out port.I wish the Show could have a bigger screen option, a video-out port, and/or video casting capability.The show should not be used as an alarm clock at this point. There's no backup battery solution at the moment. The display currently is too bright for a dark room.The angle of display and the camera cannot be adjusted.None of the Echos can answer all of the questions the Google Home can answer.None of the Echos can cast video to a TV like the Google Home can.The Echo Show is not cheap.### How will I use the Echo Show ######- Playing Music from Amazon Music- Watching videos from YouTube- Controlling home automation products and displaying camera feeds# # # Bottom Line # # # # # #The Echo Show is the best Echo available. It's also the best voice activated device available. The addition of the screen makes it infinitely better than any of the other options.While display and touch specific functionality is limited at the moment, we can trust that both Amazon and 3rd party developers will add new functionality over time.If you find the Show's price to be too high, the Echo Dot is still a great device. It's also not an expensive investment, should you decide to replace it with an Echo Show later.# # # Echo Show vs Echo # # # # # #If you are trying to decide between the Echo and the Echo Show, get the Show. You'll get better audio plus the potential for much greater functionality via the touch screen,# # # Echo Show vs Google Home # # # # # #If you want to cast video and audio, Google Home is the better choice since none of the Echos can do this.  Other than that, I recommend the Echo Show over the Google Home because it has more skills and it has a screen.Yes, the Google Home can answer more complex questions. I just think people will use these devices more for consuming content and controlling smart home products than they will use them to ask complex questions.I own both devices so I have the best of both worlds.# # # Suggested Improvements # # # # # #Add a physical home button and back button on the device and on a compatible remoteAdd a camera that can pan and zoom and track faces that are talking.Add an audio-out port.Add a separate alarm clock module that is resistant to downtime related to software patching, software crashes, network outages, etc.Provide a option for displaying video on a bigger screen via a video-out port, video casting, or bigger Echo Shows.Add the ability to customize the home page with custom apps, custom news feeds, social media feeds, etc.Add the ability to do image searches and 3D images searchesAbility to display my commute route using google maps, with trafficAdd Skype support and allow voice initiated calls.Add the ability to stream live TV from a cable box, TIVO, or the internet.Add official apps for SiriusXM, Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. The YouTube app show allow you to log in and verbally access your playlists, history, subscribed channels, etc.	Quentin Moore	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/A1HIVLFS0H3QG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	312	5	2017/06/29
B01J24C0TI	Amazon fan, hugely dissapointed!!	So I ordered 2 of these and neither worked properly. They both had connectivity issues with my network and kept dropping out. I have plenty of wifi networks to choose from in my house and these devices didn't work properly on any. I am extremely disappointed as I was really looking forward to adding these to my home automation setup. Currently I have 6 echo devices, 2 of which I have installed in cars. Those all have worked flawlessly so I don't know how they could screw this up.Device #1.  The setup was easy and it connected to my 5Ghz network no problem at first. I tested various commands on it and even dropped in on a couple of my rooms. But then I tried the video chat. It worked for about the first minute then started to drop out and finally quit. I tried a few more voice commands then suddenly it just stopped answering me and the yellow connection bar appeared on the bottom.This device also seemed to struggle with the spatial separation with the with the other Echos in the house and would never over ride them. So to test is I had  to disable all other Echo devices in earshot.So I reset device #1 to the factory settings and tried again on a different network. This time a 2.4 ghz.  Once setup, the results were exactly the same.So I was hoping this might just be this device, so I opened box #2.Device #2. I setup this one as instructed, and again the setup was easy and had no problems. I skipped passed the intro video as I had already seen it several times at this point. Then when I tried to give a voice command, it did not respond at all. I could not get it to do one thing I asked. I checked the mic and made sure it was on and nothing was obstructing it. But still nothing. By this point I am about an hour into setup and I am giving up. I tried a video call with the device and the connection was just horrible.So I felt I had enough and packed it all away to be sent back. I thought about asking for a replacement, but thought that since I just bought 2 of them, what were the chances that a 3rd would work. Given my experience with Amazon products this far, I had high hopes for this product. But I have never been let down so much.Other issues that slightly bothered me were, the in ability to change the camera angle. I wanted to put on in my kids room, so I could drop in on them and tell them to come down stairs, or give them instructions. But unfortunately, all I really saw was the upper half of their room and none of the floor. My oldest is barely 4' so this didn't help.The next thing was an audio out port. This was a major drawback for me on the first Echo. I had to crack it open and wire up and audio out port. Fortunately, the Dot fixed this issue. So why wouldn't they just throw all the best desired features into this one is beyond me.So, needless to  say I am returning. I hope that what ever the issue was, Amazon is able to resolve it. I would still love to see the next version of this.As for tech support, I tried emailing the comments and tech link Amazon sent in an email to me, but their server kept kicking it back to me. So, hopefully they will see this and get back to me through here. I hope others have a much better experience, as I really hope a product like this takes off.

B01J24C0TI	Alexa Showing Off With The Show.	Received my Echo Show yesterday as promised (overnight shipping); but I did not unpack and set it up until today. Once you are connected to your Wi-Fi network, the Echo Show goes through a software update and optimizes itself. This took about 10 minutes. After this it is time to explore what this device can do.On the home screen you will see your local time and temp. Every few seconds the screen will change, and you will be show different "Try" phrases for Alexa to do.Within minutes I was listening to one of my Pandora stations. I am a music lover and the sound from the Show does not disappoint. If you are expecting a concert from this device, you will be disappointed. My Show sits on my computer desk, and the sound is more than adequate.The screen is only 7 inches, which is plenty big for a device that will sit on a counter, stand of some kind. I read reviews from tech sites in the days before the release of this product and they were somewhat positive, but many mentioned they didn't care for the angle the screen stood at. As it sits on my desk, it is a few inches below my straight line of sight, which is perfect for me personally.I have not set the Echo Show up to communicate with other Shows, but I will in the coming days. Once I have explored more of what you can do, and watch a couple of Amazon original shows and watch a few You Tube videos, I will come back and update.If you don't have an echo already, this is the perfect time to get onboard. Amazon offers this for a one time payment of $229.00 US, or you can make a down payment and pay the balance over the next four months. This is an affordable way to get a device. Plus; if you order two; you get $100 off. The Echo Show comes in two colors, black and white. Now what will I do with my original Echo. It sits on another table unplugged and sulking. I will have to find another room to put it in.	mrc	Color: Black|Configuration: Echo Show	B01J24C0TI	/gp/pdp/profile/ABZN6D2Y2ML6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	5	2017/06/29
B01J24C0TI	No regrets!	I think it is awesome.  Always wanted something similar to this with a touchscreen/speaker combo and Amazon nailed it.  The speaker is great and has room filling sound, much more clearer than the original Echo.  The microphones are more sensitive and can pick up voices from other rooms.  The screen is great quality and bright.  Videos are crisp and clear and are accompanied by top notch sound.  Over all I am happy with this purchase and look forward to Amazon expanding what it can do, it is only going to grow from here.

It does tell me the weather and play music. Both of which I don't really have an interest in. Basically I have a very expensive paper weight.

I can't wait until I have more time to fully get into what it is able to do.

B00X4WHP5E	Was very disappointed to find out this is nothing near the hype	Was very disappointed to find out this is nothing near the hype. I ask all kinds of things only to hear the reply "hmmmmm don't know that one". Aside from that I bought this and a dot so I could voice control my lights with my smart things hub. I have been doing all kinds of things for weeks and I cant get this to talk to my smart hub. It does tell me the weather and play music. Both of which I don't really have an interest in. Basically I have a very expensive paper weight.	Lector	Color: Black|Configuration: Amazon Echo	B00X4WHP5E	/gp/pdp/profile/A38A5I45IXC3HJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	1	2017/07/27
B00X4WHP5E	Amazon Prime Day score!	This is pretty cool, but there needs to be more options of things Alexa can do. I wish my Onxyo receivers, Samsung Tv's, and Xfinity were all compatible. I really like that Alexa is connected to my Amazon Prime and she can stream whatever music immediately,  I just wish it was through my stereo instead if a tiny speaker. This technology is a great start,  but has a way to go to be truly awesome!

B073D4YV9P	Super cute	Super cute, but it's not very thick. I don't think it would withstand a school year abuse with books and all kinds of stuff inside. Maybe for a Kindergartner or a 1st grader...but then the size may be too big for them. I'd say for a laptop and a couple of folders is fine. I bought 3 different ones when they were on sale for less than $20 on Prime Day.

B073D4YV9P	Nice size	So I'm not sure why this has so many negative comments and reviews on the size of this backpack. I bought it for my 7 year old who is smaller in size and it honestly seems a little big for him but as far as not having enough room in the bag I see no problem. It would easily fit a few books, folders and lunchbox. JMO tho!! A little pricey I thought, but it is UA and that's what he was excited about so i guess that's what matters. He picked the green and black bag and the colors are awesome! And with it being mostly black you won't really be able to see the dirt I'm sure it will accumulate. We went with the cheap $10 Wal-Mart bag last year and it didn't last half way thru the year without falling apart. I hope this one lasts at least thru this year without any problems and a 2nd year would just be icing on the cake!	geotraxmaniac	Size: One Size|Color: Graphite/Black	B016CA08OE	/gp/pdp/profile/A26XQ63UXLMBMT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2017/07/10

B073D4YV9P	Quality is worth the price when it comes to backpacks.	I've had this backpack in my cart for months now and I've watched the price fluctuate. It started off at $44.95. When I saw it went down to $22.95 I jumped on it! And boy I'm glad that I did.My son will be in second grade this fall and he is in love with UA items. It's hard for me that he doesn't want Paw Patrol or Hot Wheels backpacks anymore because they're not "cool" :( But over time, I've learned those character backpacks don't last a whole school year anyways - sometimes you need to spend a little more money for a quality backpack that will actually last.I love the vibrant colors, we chose the navy blue and bright orange. It is a perfect size for a school aged child.I will update as time goes on of any issues, but as of now it is a great purchase and I will probably be ordering another one in the near future for my other children.	911Kaitlin	Size: One Size|Color: Royal/Blaze Orange	B016CA07MM	/gp/pdp/profile/A510GFZQONEXJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	5	2017/05/29

B073D4YV9P	Really nice pack!  See the review for it's pros and cons!	This backpack seems very durable!  That is the top thing I look for in a backpack...aside from side water bottle pockets.  Side water bottle pockets are why we replaced our son's Jansport pack with this one.  I do like all of the different pockets.  There is a laptop sleeve.  There is a place to put a device that has a fleecy material for non-scratching.  The shoulder straps are padded and seem comfy.  The bottom material is thick enough to hand wear and tear.The use of this pack is to go to our classical conversations group once a week and for traveling.  I expect the traveling to really show how tough the bag is.If I had one criticism the pack doesn't seem super deep/fat. If you were toting a laptop and trying to cram a lot of books in there I am not sure it would be able to do it.  The other packs we have are a bit fatter.  I think this one is still larger than the one we replaced, though, and our son is not toting a laptop for the considerable future so no problem for us!  It was just worth noting!If I have helped you I would love a helpful vote!  Thanks!

B073D4YV9P	GREAT backpack!	My son is a huge fan of under armour.  The backpacks are expensive, but well worth the cost.  We've had less expensive ones and ended up having to replace within a few months of daily use during the school year.  These are going on 5 months of use now and still look brand new!  I would highly recommend.  My son is 10 and on the shorter side and this fits him well and is able to carry all he needs for school.  We also got the matching lunch kit which I would also highly recommend.	ssmith	Size: One Size|Color: Graphite/Black	B016CA08OE	/gp/pdp/profile/A19OEZ6DJB2EY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	4	5	2016/11/29

The quality of the materials is really top notch.The main compartment is very large and can handle plenty of books.  There is a pocket for a laptop/tablet and the smaller front pocket is lined so it won't scratch a phone or iPod.  The medium size pocket is the perfect size for a lunch box/snack bag.Hopefully she still likes it in a few years!

B073D4YV9P	Great backpack for 8 year old	My 8 year old loves Under Armour.  We've been through shirts, pants, shorts, shoes.  We used a drawstring bag this summer for the pool that was amazing.  He needed a new school bag and so I went with this one.  We got black with green.  He loves green so it was perfect for him.  It's well made and durable.  The Under Armour shirts never hold up and are not worth the cost.  The shoes are wrecked in less than 6 months.  But this backpack?  Its great!  A full recommendation.	A.

B073D4YV9P	I thought the quality for the brand would be much better than this	Unfortunately, I thought the quality for the brand would be much better than this.  This was for my son and although the size was appropriate the quality was not close to what I expected Under Armour to produce.  Plastic type feel, depth was not suitable and there was an overall lack of attention to detail.  I have received better backpacks for less than what the price of this pack cost.  I did return the package because of this as well as it being to small to hold 1 binder and a lunch box for school.

B01GY7DSHY	Amazing quality, but slightly long on my short legs lol	I absolutely love the material, the style, the high waist! they are very comfortable and great quality. My only dislike is not the product itself, but because I have shorter legs, I'm 5'4'', they are rather long and go below my calf, so they don't hug my calf. Again nothing against the product which im still wearing them anyway, but I have to pull up the legs slightly to get them to hit in the right spot, so they look a little bunched. But the xl fits me great everywhere else. just keep in mind when ordering that these are a slightly longer capri.	C.

B01GY7DSHY	These are great!	Love these yoga pants! They are a little snug but they feel really high quality and look very nice. They are form fitting and rise up to my belly button, but they way the compress actually holds in my excess weight really well without making me feel squished. They make me look more slender but still feel comfortable which can be a difficult thing to achieve. As a bonus I didn't even know they would have a slimming effect, I was just expecting a pair of black capris! Very happy with these yoga pants and may end up buying more eventually.

B01GY7DSHY	Not a true compression pant.	I purchased these thinking they were compression tights, but they really aren't. However they are very comfortable and no see through. The calves are loose and being only 5'2" I would prefer them to be a smidge shorter. But because they don't fit tight around the calves, I can't pull them up. Instead, they need to be rolled up or just leave them down like crop pants.	Barbara	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B01GY7DUMC	/gp/pdp/profile/A3CP28P24PA956/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/07/24

B01GY7DSHY	Very Slimming	Perfect pants!  I am 5' 51/2" and 134 lbs and the medium is a perfect fit.  Being higher waisted and the type fabric used, they definitely flatten your tummy without being too tight around the abdomen.  These are not "compression" leggings but they are very fitted.  Fabric is a great weight, not too thin, and retains its shape well.  Washes well in cold water without fading.  I like these pants so much I ordered 2 more pair.

B01GY7DSHY	Hate the waistband	I hate the waist. It is high but not high enough to be comfortable. It has a large waistband but not enough to roll down either. It hits right at the belly button, which I hate. I would say go a size up. Maybe that would fix the problem. They are nice and tight though.

They keep my giggly belly nice and tight when I'm working out which makes things much easier. I wear these ALL the time though. They are like spanks all over, really flattering. Not so tight they're uncomfortable or restricting though. Every time I wear these people ask me if I've lost weight. Buy them! Buy 3 of them!

B01GY7DSHY	Not horrible	I ordered these sort of on a whim; I needed new yoga tights, and I prefer capris, and the price was right.  When they came I was concerned that the fabric would be too heavy, and when I tried them on I found them...snug.  But I figured that returning them would be more of a hassle, so I kept them, and honestly they are fine.  I don't find them too heavy and they are perfectly comfortable for yoga. So despite my initial misgivings I can say that I like them.  If you are simply looking for  a serviceable pair of yoga capris, you could do worse than ordering these.

They're beyond comfortable and really the perfect kind of material in my opinion. They're more of a matte cotton-y material in appearance as opposed to the spandex-y leggings that I'm not always a fan of look-wise. I have 2 problems with them though - they attract any and all lint the moment they leave the dryer and also they pill in the crotch, after just a few wears :( If it weren't for the fact that I'm hard pressed to remove all of the lint with a lint roller I wouldn't be so bothered by the fact that they're lint magnets but because I really never have them lint free except when they're freshly laundered. Only reason why there's a star off. If you live in a lint free house-hold these are the perfect leggings for you.

B01GY7DSHY	Thick material, comfy, and keeps everything in.	Order one size up. I'm usually a small but ordered a medium and they fit well as a Medium. I now own two pairs, but the waist fits differently in the most recent pair I ordered. It is tighter than my other one, granted I've been wearing the other one for about 2 months now, maybe, twice a week. Although, I don't remember it fitting as snug when I first tried them on. Overall, I would recommend these because they are thick material, keep the belly in and very comfy. Pilling does occur near the crotch area so we'll see how long they last, but right now, it's not a huge deal. I flip them inside out when I wash them to help minimize pilling elsewhere. Best of all, no cameltoe(!) -- unlike their other product (Baleaf Women's Fold Over High Waist Lounge Yoga Bootleg Pants Black Size), which I would not recommend.

B01GY7DSHY	Love them, but too long for short girls	Love these just like I love the full length leggings. They are not see through whatsoever. They are super high waisted which I love since they don't get pushed down by my stomach. The only downfall is that I'm 5'2" and these are practically pants on me instead of capris. I'm going to have to hem them which will work out fine because they don't flare out at the end like some capris do. I also wish they were a little big more of a richer black though.	Kimberly M.

B01GY7DSHY	Nice but didn't fit right. Waist did roll some.	They fit okay but many reviews touted the nice waistband and how it didn't roll down. It did roll down a little too much on me after testing them out in different positions so I'm returning. I also was hoping they would be silkier but these are like thick matte jersey and I don't think they would be very moisture wicking. One plus is they aren't tight on the legs and calves so if you're legs are big these would be comfortable. I'm an apple shaped and these would work well for a pear shaped gal. This is just my opinion.	NanaC	Color: Charcoal|Size: X-Large	B01GY7DVT4	/gp/pdp/profile/A1GN7UEC73RV05/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2017/05/21

B01GY7DSHY	Great at first....but...	Bought these pants for my mom, who wanted to have something longer than cycling shorts. They arrived and fit perfectly. However, the reason we bought these was for a cycling trip. Within a few days of wearing these, the seams of the pants started to come apart and shredding all along the legs. Keep in mind we may have been cycling every day, but in no way was it strenuous activity. They were also the perfect size so it wasn't that they were being overstretched! Just extremely disappointed because I have other Baleaf brand items and it just seems to be a hit and miss with them.

B01GY7DSHY	Tight waist (updated)	Very small waist. I'm 5'3" 110 lbs and I got a small (charcoal color).  The waist is really tight and if there is any skrinkage, they will be unwearable. Nice length and fabric though.*Update 6/25 - after my original review, the seller contacted me out of concern and offered to send me the next size up. I really appreciated that. I have worn them a few times and they are of great quality. I do think the charcoal color runs very small based on my experience and other reviewers. The waist is very snug and disproportionate - great fit otherwise. I would suggest going up 1 or 2 sizes. I am 110 lbs and have a slight "muffin top" with these pants in a size medium.

They were much tighter than the regular waist capri's but not so much so that I couldn't get all this lusciousness in them! lol.

B01GY7DSHY	Black leggings fit better if you need more room...	I bought the XL (I have a 40" waist) and the fit was mostly comfortable.  I have slender hips / legs and felt the legs perfectly comfortable.  The fabric is thick and snug, and these are truly high waist with a very large pocket in the front.  I fit my cell in there snugly but wouldn't feel comfortable going through a whole workout w/ it tucked in there.There is a thick seam around the hip bone attaching the bottom half of the leggings to the high waist.  If you get the right size, you shouldn't feel the seam, but since these are borderline too snug, I felt the seam for the first 10 mins, then forgot about it.I bought these in black and charcoal grey, but found the black (fabric and all) to be much more comfortable.  The charcoal grey does dig into my waist so not too sure about those, but will definitely be wearing the black on a regular basis.

B01GY7DSHY	Amazing pants!	I'm a yoga pant kinda lady, and let me tell you, these are the BEST I have ever worn.  In my life.My qualifications include:>having 6 kids, starting with twins>5 c-sections>detest ab work>about 15 lbs overweightI ordered these pants because of the high waist and control top. I hoped they would help with all of the above and not strangle me.So today I gave them a try. And let me tell you I have spent the entire day feeling amazing!  The high waist has kept everything my babies ruined and held it right in place. The legs were firmly fitted, yet allowed for air circulation where necessary.  Not all yoga pants accomplish all of this.I think I need a few more pair!So go for it, you'll be checking yourself out in every reflective surface possible, like me!

B01GY7DSHY	Great for crossFit or any type of workout	I wore these to my first crossFit class. I did not find them to be too warm, and I appreciated how thick and sturdy they felt. I'm about 5'6 1/2 and found the capris length to sit comfortably between my ankle and knee. I like that these make me feel supported, but not constricted. I have ordered 3 more pairs in different colors for my other 3 workout days. I am excited to see the difference between the mesh panels in the "space print" fabrics, as I have only worn the solid black so far.I also found the high waist to be a great comfort so I don't have to worry about my backside showing while doing rowing or other bending over movements. The waistband doesn't cut in or cause me any discomfort, and I'm sensitive about fabrics binding around my midsection due to surgery scars from 3.5 months ago. Overall there isn't anything else I could ask for in a pair of workout pants (except maybe a magical property that makes them repel cat hair? :-) )	S.

B01GY7DSHY	but they should fit better over the next few weeks as the baby weight ...	These are now my go-to workout pants! I'm 5'11" and 160 (5 weeks post partum) and ordered medium. They're a touch snug, but they should fit better over the next few weeks as the baby weight comes off. The pants stay in place through movement and don't fall down. They are only slightly see through if stretched a lot and you look really hard, so I'm not worried about it. For the price, you can't beat it!	E. H.

B01GY7DSHY	Will buy more	I uses these yoga pants to run miles in, and they hold up great! The gusseted panel makes stretching out before and after easy and modest. I wear these to the gym, and have no trouble doing crunches, they stay up and cover my legs. I may buy another pair when my schedule changes and I have time to go to the gym more often, this pair was great! Side note: you can't wear sparkly panties with these, the sparkle shows through. I usually wear plain cotton boyshorts under these, and have no problem with see-through-ness.

B01GY7DSHY	Great pants for this plus-sized runner	I LOVE these pants! I'm a plus-sized runner (5'2", size 18) and carry most of my weight in my mid-section. I found the size XL to be a perfect fit. They're definitely form fitting, which I like in a running pant, but they're not too tight. I ran in them for the first time today and they did not budge at all! Even with my iPhone 6s in the front pocket, the pants did not move during my run. The phone also fit perfectly into the pocket and was held securely in place. I will definitely be ordering more of these pants.	Ashley	Color: Black|Size: X-Large	B01GY7DUMC	/gp/pdp/profile/A1Z8JPJ74R2CN3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2017/04/03
B01GY7DSHY	Best Workout Capris!	I'm obsessed with these yoga capris. They are better than the $50 ones I bought from Fabletics or Under Armour or Nike. They have just the right amount of stretch to make it comdfortable for working out, but it's not loose or falling down. They kind of make me look thinner because it compresses my stomach area a little. The fabric is super comfortable and soft, not stiff like Fabletics. The waist does go pretty high, almost all the way to the underneath of my bra- but I'm not mad at it. Very flattering! I need more color options so I can buy one for every day of the week!

B01GY7DSHY	Love love love!	Incredibly comfortable!  Solid material.  Definitely ordering more!  Edit: I have now purchased in both charcoal and black and love them both.  I will say that I like the charcoal a little bit more as the material is a bit more supportive while the black doesn't feel quite as supportive and is a little silkier-feeling to the touch.  Regardless, they're both very comfortable and I love the small hidden pocket in the waistband too!  Can't wait to buy more- great quality and great price.

B01GY7DSHY	Finally!!!	Finally! Several years ago, my sister gave me spandex pants that went over my stomach and smoothed everything down. I was never able to find another pair like that until now. I am 5'8, size 8, and I got a medium. Its as long as pictured on the model (between the knee and ankle) and might be longer if youre shorter than 5'8.

B01GY7DSHY	Buy them now.	These. Leggings. Are. Amazing.I had a baby a year ago, and things around my waistline have...shifted. All of my other leggings and tights and workout pants hit me in a spot on my midsection that makes it necessary to constantly adjust them over and over and over again. (FYI I'm about 6' tall and size 16. I ordered size XXL.)These leggings? Didn't have to adjust them once!They are also super comfortable on my huge calves. They are long enough to stay put through my whole workout.The fabric is very soft, and the description is accurate: you can't see through them.In short, these leggings are totally worth the price and more. I am going to order a few more pairs. Oh, and this is my first review of a product on Amazon, that's how much I love them!

B01GY7DSHY	Not fitted at the very bottom	I am 5'5" 145lbs, 7 months pregnant. I got a size large in black. They were comfortable, roomy and not see through. The problem I have is the very bottom isn't fitted like a legging. I still wear them though. I'm shocked because I have large legs. Maybe I was sent a straight crop instead of a legging crop, I don't know. I have the ankle version and I fit both the medium and large. They wash and wear well. A little pilling in the inner thigh occurs after washing them many times, but I have big thighs.

B01GY7DSHY	No compression but decent pants	The one problem area that I try to hide is my stomach. So I like to wear a sports bra and high-waisted leggings while working out.  I am 5 foot 1 and 129 pounds. I ordered the medium and although they seemed to fit, and the waistband rose above my belly button there was absolutely no compression or tightness. Therefore, I felt that it more so accentuated my round belly. This defeats the purpose for me purchasing these pants altogether, so I will likely just return them. The overall quality of the pant is decent, though.	T. Scott	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B01GY7DSHY	/gp/pdp/profile/A2EE9VFSSAZFUD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	3	2017/03/21

B01GY7DSHY	Excellent quality, durable.	These pants feel high quality, comparable or even better than a much more expensive brand. They are not see through at all and are somewhat thick but not overly hot. I love the high waist but you can also fold the waistband down if you want. After several washes they have not faded or pilled at all.	LisaC	Color: Black|Size: Small	B01GY7DRKW	/gp/pdp/profile/A2MX05ES7TA8ZV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/02/28
B01GY7DSHY	Poor quality.  Large tear noticed second time I put on!  Cannot wear.	When I first tried these on, I loved them!  They were fairly thin, compared to other pants I had purchased of Baleaf here on Amazon, but for a workout I felt that was ok, and I LOVED the high waist!  Sadly, the second time I put them on I notice a huge cut straight across the top of the leg where it joins the abdomen.  I cannot wear them as it will likely extend across the entire abdomen.  I expected them to last at least a couple wears!  I guess I need to spend more money on quality.  Too bad because I really liked the fit and other pairs I had bought of this brand.	Maria A.

B01GY7DSHY	Great Leggings... Get them in gray.	Love these leggings. Fit well, not see through, and very comfortable. Three things to know: (1) They are very high-waisted. I don't mind this aspect, I actually prefer it because I have a long torso, but I could see how it could be uncomfortable to someone else if that's not your thing. (2) They are slightly loose at the bottoms. It's not like they flare out, but they just don't adhere right to your calves. I think it's a flattering look, just letting you know. (3) Most importantly, this review is for the GRAY leggings, which i think are perfect. They are stretchy but the fabric has a cotton aspect/ texture to it that looks and feels great. My husband, seeing how jazzed I was about the gray leggings, ordered me a black pair and I did not like them as much... they fit well but are just nylon/spandex so they are a bit shiny and look like every other pair of workout pants I have.

B01GY7DSHY	Skip these	I will say that I like the fit and the high waist.  But I am short and they are as long as pants, not capri length at all.  Also the fabric does not breathe at all, when I wear them they make me sweat and feel like its a hundred degrees (I am in CT in winter!) Also I am a bigger girl and my thighs touch when I walk and after only 1 day of wearing around the house they pilled in between the legs, so disappointing.	K.

I am a size 18 and have a hard time finding leggings or Capri leggings that fit right without pinching, bunching, causing camel toe issues, or showing underwear through the material. These don't do any of those horrible things.These yoga capris are perfect when it comes to fit, coverage (no see through underwear issues), material, and workmanship. They don't feel flimsy or like the seams will give up easily.I wear these for kickball practices, running drills, and for games. As a large woman, I put my clothing to the test when I work out. These pass with flying colors.I would buy these again in a heartbeat and would recommend them to anyone else thinking about purchasing them.	Geisele V.

B01GY7DSHY	Good leggings!	These are great! I have been buying many athletic leggings lately... these aren't my favorite, but I like them enough to keep them and wear them. They hit a little bit higher on my calf then I prefer, but I do like how high the waist is. I also bought the 90-degree by Reflex (high waist tummy control capri), a very comparable legging and prefer the tummy control of the Reflex leggings to the Baleaf.

B01GY7DSHY	Good pants, no "fading" pattern	I usually wear a large in gym pants but these are a pretty loose-fitting material, so I had to go down a size. Even with the smaller size they are definitely not compression pants. However, I do like the high waist, and the best part about them is that the pattern stays true even when they stretch. So your behind doesn't turn white when you bend over (and no see-through).

B01GY7DSHY	5/5 - I love the material on the leggings this company makes	Aesthetics: 5/5 - I love the material on the leggings this company makes. It is similar to the Lululemon leggings material. The black is indeed black.Sizing/Fit: 2/5 - I ordered the medium because I was a medium in these other leggings sold by the same company Baleaf Women's Ankle Legging Inner Pocket Non See-through Ruby Wine Size M. They were loose, as I constantly had to pull them up, and the ankle wasn't 7/8 like I thought it would be. That last part wasn't part of the description, so I won't let that affect my review but it still didn't fit me.Price: 4/5 - Pretty good pricing for the material it's made of. For a medium quality legging in general it's pretty standard.Overall rating: 4/5 - They're nice leggings but definitely  bigger than their other leggings. I would suggest going a size down. I ended up giving them to my mom so at least someone is using them...	Jessica A.	Color: Black|Size: Medium	B01GY7DSHY	/gp/pdp/profile/A1TFTISZOZQAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	5	4	2016/11/30

B01GY7DSHY	Very nice workout leggings	I've worn these leggings several times now.  I love them for jogging because they help hold my tummy in.  I'm 5'4" with a longer torso and these leggings come up to just below my belly button.  They are a nice thick material that helps smooth me out and they are very comfortable.  No awkward swishing sounds when I walk.  They are a teensy bit longer than I would like but I just roll them up and they stay put.  Perfect.  Planning to order more.Note on sizing: I'm usually a medium in leggings.  I bought some baleaf leggings in the lower waisted version and they were a little too tight.  My waist is 29 inches and my hips are 37 inches and I like these better in size large.  Hopefully that helps!

B01GY7DSHY	Dana review	Good quality but I recommend you go up a size.  Nice fabric and seems to be well made for the price. I ordered the black and gray in aXXL after trying a smaller size.  I am 5'7" and weigh about 190.  It's hard to find a workout pant that comes in plus sizes but this fits the bill.  I really like the charcoal gray better than the black because the black is a little shinny. I am keeping both pairs.  They are flattering and comfortable enough to wear all day and I do recommend these but go up a size if you like comfort.

B01GY7DSHY	It Stays Up!	Really nice high waisted workout capri that actually stays up! For once, I wasn't pulling or tugging at my pants during my HIIT workout.  The material is nice. It's not as see-through as some other pants in the same price point. It offers some compression but not enough of how I expected them to be based on some other reviews. I would suggest sizing down if you want a more compressed snug fit where you feel held in, supported, or "locked and loaded." I ordered the large, and it's fine, but I think the medium would have fit me perfectly.	nspen	Color: Black|Size: Large	B01GY7DTJ6	/gp/pdp/profile/A257E97E2OGFT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	4	2016/10/15

B01GY7DSHY	FINALLY!	These leggings are awesome!! I love wearing leggings but I only wear athletic ones that are kind of thick (ya know to kinda keep everything tight). I'm only 5' so finding a true capri is hard. I hate when they hit at my knee or just above my ankle and these are perfect! Which means for all the taller gals these might be kind of short. I tried squatting in these to make sure you can't see through and they passed! I included a picture in the light with my leg tucked to attempt to show they don't go see through when stretched. I've only worn them once so I can't say how durable they are but they're super comfy! For reference I am 5' about 140lbs and have athletic thighs and calves and I got the medium. I'm short so they come almost all the way up to my bra but I don't mind. I will definitely buy more!

B01GY7DSHY	Love these, will probably buy another few pairs	I love these pants. Let me start off by saying I paid full price for these, and this is a real review. There are a few details about these pants which I found slightly different from the listing.First, I'm directly between two sizes and so I chose the higher size for comfort. As a result, the waist goes super high, higher than in the photo. It is a solid inch to two inches above my belly button. For me, this is great. It bothers me to feel constricted or pinched, and the tall waistband sits comfortably in the narrow part of my waist. I wear looser shirts with my yoga pants instead of tank tops, so this has not affected my fashion style in any way.Second, the material is not the smooth & shiny yoga pant material I'm used to. It's sort of like a mix between cotton yoga pants and shiny yoga pants. This is fine with me; the only downside is that the pants do tend to pick up lint and little pieces of whatever a lot easier than normal pants and I need to pat down my butt every time I stand up to make sure I'm not carrying around carpet fuzz or something.So why did I give this 5 stars? Because these arrived about two weeks ago and I have literally worn them every single day, all day, and they are still comfortably snug instead of stretched out, they feel great, and they look presentable enough to wear out of the house on an errand or to grab a bite.For sizing/dimensions: I am a 5'11" woman who weighs about 145-150lbs, which is a normal weight for my height (I'm thin in a "fit" way, versus in a "skinny" way). I bought XL size, and probably could have pulled off a Large, however I really dislike being squeezed into clothing in any way. The crop goes the perfect halfway distance between my knee and my ankle. The bottom part of the pants is a little loose on my calves, although not in a way which is noticeable to other people.If I'm being honest with you, Amazon Review friends, I will probably end up buying another two pairs of these to fulfill my lifelong attempt to avoid wearing real pants.

B01GY7DSHY	Nice, soft material	Fit as expected. The pants are thick enough and not see through. Nice, soft material."Tummy control" could be a lot better. Basically just a wider, higher waist band. Doesn't shape or "suck" anything in so don't expect that. Overall I'm happy with the pants and would buy another pair.PS...For my fellow vertically challenged sisters: I am 5' tall and the pants go to about an inch or so above my ankle.	Jill T.

B01GY7DSHY	In the keep pile	Honest product review here: like it, am keeping them. That said, a few things for other buyers to note. 1) The medium fits like a large. The legs are a bit long for capri length (I am 5'5" ) and I have to sort of tug them up a bit to make them work or they go long and are a little wide on the very bottom end seam on the legs. 2) There is just a smidge bit of maternity look to these. Don't kill me, that is probably why they are so comfy. I bought mine in the charcoal grey so maybe that accentuates the "panel" seam over the belly. I will be mostly wearing longer tees or tanks anyway so not a deal breaker for me. 3) consider a thong?

B01GY7DSHY	Lighter weight pants	This is the 2nd pair of pants I've kept from these guys. This style is lighter in weight than the "Baleaf Women's Yoga Capri Legging Inner Pocket Dewberry Size XL" and has a ventilating mesh panel on the outsides of each leg which helps keep things cool in warmer conditions. They also sit a bit higher on the waist, which is nice when doing serious hikes with bending and such.

B06W9LJ6W7	Love the look...fit questionable	I've seen this pattern on Tom's website but my size was not available. Luckily I found it on Amazon. I already have 2 pairs of Tom's so am familiar with the fit and sizing. A few reviewers stated this is not an original Tom's product due to the loose insole. I bought my other Toms from Toms and verified that the insoles are loose, set in place, not adhered. The reason this is 4 stars is because the right shoe did not fit properly. The left shoe was fine but the right one was tight across the top. I compared the lil 'V' shape elastic and it did appear smaller so I measured it and the difference is very slight but it did make a difference. So I was starting to think I got a knockoff or a reject. While debating to return I wore it in the house for a few hours (as much as my right foot could endure) for a few days. It did eventually loosen up after the breaking in period. But I never had to do that before with my other 2 pairs bought directly from Toms. Now I can wear this pair comfortably. I worry that the elastic V might over stretch from wear in time. But until then I will enjoy!

B06W9LJ6W7	These are not fake	Say what you want, but I hate paying full price for TOMS because they simply do not last, so I always buy them on Amazon instead.

Sometimes they are leather, sometimes they are rubber, and sometimes they do or not not have arch support. These are not the most comfortable pair I own (they have the rubber soles) but I love them all the same.	catglasses12	Size: 10 B(M) US|Color: Slate Blue	B01H60VUXC	/gp/pdp/profile/A2VETFYLREELPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	11	4	2017/06/03

B06W9LJ6W7	I like these so much I might order a backup for when I wear them out!	These are probably my favorite pair of Toms to date (and I wear this brand almost exclusively)! I ordered what are essentially slippers (the forged iron gray wool) and I couldn't be happier. The inside is mega soft and the addition of this lining did NOT affect the fit (an 8.5 through and through!) The exterior is like a cable knit sweater which I absolutely love. While I don't intend on wearing them outdoors, I do appreciate the actual sole of the shoe being the same as their other slip ons (which makes going out to grab the mail doable). Overall 5 stars!

B06W9LJ6W7	TOMS Always a good fit	A few years ago, EVERYONE was wearing Toms. I resisted as they were 'too trendy' for me.  But when I saw a woman wearing them, and got a closer look, I was pleasantly surprised. They look almost like Town & Country canvas slip ons that I used to wear as a teen. They were sold in skate shops only.I took a chance and tried some Toms.  Kicking myself for not having tried them before!  They are true to size and wear beautifully. This is my 3rd pair and I hope they never stop making them. I wear duty boots for 16-18 hrs a day, and all I want are Toms when I'm off duty. I've worn them for all day treks in SF.

B06W9LJ6W7	these shoes are GREAT. I'm usually a size 7	Not sure if these are real Tom's (these are my first pair,) but they definitely LOOK it and even have the Tom's tag. That being said, these shoes are GREAT. I'm usually a size 7.5, so I was a little wary buying a size 8. When they arrived, I was devastated because they were WAY too tight! Luckily my roommate explained that they are made of canvas and will stretch over time, and they did! I'm a front desk manager of a hotel, so I'm running around constantly. Thesee are now my go-to pair of shoes. They look classy and they're comfortable as all get out. I've never gotten so much as a blister or a pinched toe from them. If you're thinking about buying them, stop thinking. Buy them!	Savy	Size: 8 B(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B00K369NJA	/gp/pdp/profile/A1PM487EGW9CFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2017/02/16

B06W9LJ6W7	Wide feet take caution...	First off, I saw some reviews about these being fakes. I don't believe they are fakes, but I'd be willing to bet they are second quality either that or TOMS has changed something. Its been a few year since I've bought a pair. Anyway the ones I've bought in the past are 7s and fit perfectly. These? Couldn't get my feet in. It seemed so weird though because length wise they lined up with my foot perfectly. Read another review where a woman said that she removed the insole and hers fit so I tried it and it worked! Slipped right on like they were supposed to and I just added something thinner. Maybe they changed the insole thickness? I dunno. You'll probably be fine if you have a narrow foot but if your feet even border on the wide side rip that sucker out. Still giving it four stars because after the initial hassle they fit like the TOMS I love. Cute too!

B06W9LJ6W7	Ehhh	I love the pattern and standard TOMs feel and wearability, but within just over a month, the bottoms of the shoes have begun peeling off already?!?

I've worn these consistently, but not any outrageous amount, in any inclement condition, on any harsh surfaces.

B06W9LJ6W7	Great If They Fit You	I actually returned these because the fit just wasn't right for me.  I have had several pairs of TOMs dating back to the first year I ever saw them in a store (Nordstom's) and really love them.  However, I find that TOMs sizing varies a lot from year to year and often from shoe pair to shoe pair.  I have a short wide foot, and I find that the classic TOMs shoe (only style I have ever purchased) tend to run a bit to long and narrow for my foot.  They do stretch a teeny bit so that helps.  BASED ON OTHER PAIRS I OWN:  They hold up better than you would think from looking at them and are very comfortable.	Barbara G.

B06W9LJ6W7	Beware of Faux Sherling Lining for a Narrow Fit	I really enjoy Toms typically. This pair has a thick "Faux shearling lining" that it appears the shoe maker didn't take into account when designing the shoe. Normal, non-lined Toms fit great on me. These feel like they're the same width as unlined Toms, and then the lining takes up too much of the space inside the shoe. It kind of feels like I'm wearing two pairs of socks in them - but I'm not wearing socks. Totally bummed.	Sara H.

Very disappointing but the look of the shoe is actually nice.	C. Elrod	Size: 8 B(M) US|Color: Silver Metalic	B018TCYAPG	/gp/pdp/profile/A3HA3HF7JZQEB1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	1	2017/01/02

B06W9LJ6W7	Favorite dry winter day shoe	Oh my these are my new favorites for winter. Mind you our winter days are typically in the 50s. The cozy liner really keeps my feet warm.  They're as comfy as the classic Toms but just a little cozier! My feet don't like any other type of shoe. I don't recommned these on wet days or off street wear. The sizing are true to size. I wear an 8.5 and Toms 8.5. I ordered these in 8.5. When I first put them on they were a little snug, maybe due to the lining but quickly got comfy. I'd wear these everyday if i could.	sodagirl	Size: 8.5 B(M) US|Color: Black Woolen	B007ND8G44	/gp/pdp/profile/AIKRUA9NY4JCL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/12/29

B06W9LJ6W7	Be sure you're okay with silver glitter...	I like this shoe because it's comfortable.  I really wish Toms would make the top of the shoe shorter (so it only goes slightly proximal to the toes and not so high up close to the ankle), but whatever.  That's their style.  I did think these were black with grey, but I guess I didn't read the description very well.  The glitter is very silver.  Kind of looks cheesy, I think.  My boyfriend made fun of them, so we call them my MJ (Michael Jackson) shoes.  I mostly wear them around the house 'cause they don't fit my clothing style as well as I'd hoped.

B06W9LJ6W7	but I own many pairs of Tom's and they usually stretch out and are comfortable pretty quickly	They are usually always right to begin with, but I own many pairs of Tom's and they usually stretch out and are comfortable pretty quickly. This is my second pair of the black with the black sole -  they look less casual when you want to wear dresses and want to get away with comfy shoes.

B06W9LJ6W7	Too small, suspect fake	I read the reviews and they were really mixed. Some say they are "fake" Tom's and poor quality while others rave about them. They were a good price so I decided to give them a shot as I needed all black shoes for work. Also, I have one other pair of Tom's and they are comfortable so I figured why not. These were a mistake. I'm a size 7 1/2 in EVERY SINGLE SHOE I OWN. These did not even fit me. I couldn't get them on at all. My other Tom's are the same size and no issues. This leads me to believe that possibly they are fake because usually fake shoes are made in other countries and those sizes run small especially in China. Not ever cool for Amazon to allow a seller to sell fake shoes. Maybe the seller is unaware or was falsely sold these shoes as the real deal. But I do have to agree that something is off on these shoes.	Heidi Helfrich	Size: 7.5 B(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B00K369MUA	/gp/pdp/profile/A22GXU9CW15KCX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	8	1	2016/11/06

B06W9LJ6W7	A-okay to me	I read a lot of reviews on these before purchasing. A lot of reviews said they were knockoffs. I am not so sure they are. Compared to a pair I have from Nordstroms, they seem just fine. I think a potential reason you can get these cheaper at Amazon is due to quality inconsistencies. Though I don't equate that to "fake". As far as my pair, 5.5 all black, they're fine. The label isn't crooked or anything. They are a little snug, but I recall that with my other TOMS and they loosen up, so it's not a concern for me - I only mentioned it since they may be a TAD snigger than my Nordy ones.Bottom line, if I can save a few bucks a get 2 day shipping, I'm likely going to go that route every time.

B06W9LJ6W7	Great as always	I purchased my first pair of toms back in about 2012 and still have them to this day, however I purchased a florescent orange which isnt my taste so I dyed them black and theyve been great even still in 2016 for weekly use besides in the cold chicago winters. I decided to finally purchase a pair of ALL black and buy my second pair. I purchased a 8.5 when I normally wear a 9 (I remember the guy at Zumies telling me to always get a half size down and they stretch to your normal size) It was a bit tight and uncomfortable to put on at first, but just wearing them around the house and letting them slowly stretch theyre already almost at my normal size. If you want a looser fit, get your normal size and they'll stretch to half a size bigger or if you want a tighter fit go half a size down unless you have wider feed, toms are narrow but they do widen over time. Toms are my go to shoe especially when going out to the bars because theyre simple, cute and super comfortable. I can wear them all day!

B06W9LJ6W7	Runs small, minimal arch support.	These shoes definetely run small - I suppose the idea is to break them in. For reference, I am a 6.5, and I always order 6.5 in keds, for example. The 6.5 in Toms was so small that while breaking them in I had red marks on my feet. Aside from sizing issues, they are not very comfortable as they provide only the most minimal arch support. I would not wear them all day. If ordered a half size larger, I imagine they could be a slip on suitable for a couple hours worth of wear.

B06W9LJ6W7	and look like the pictures	Cute shoes! They are high quality and seem well made, and look like the pictures. My only issue is that they are tight on the top. The shoe itself is long enough and my toes have lots of room but the top is very tight. I'd been told that you can stretch them out with heat and fuzzy socks, so I tried it and so far it's working. After wearing them a couple of times the top has stretched out a bit and they are more comfortable. Will be purchasing more in different colors!

B06W9LJ6W7	Another great pair of TOMS	I LOVE TOMS. I have atleast 6-7 different pairs and it's perfect for the summer. It's literally the only shoe brand that doesn't give me shoe blisters.The black one looks lovely. All black on the outside, including the sole; which looks really classy. On the inside, the sides of the canvas is a multicolored, striped print. The inside soles are brown with the name of the company imprinted. I have narrow feet, so the shoes fit me fine and give me some wiggle room too. Shoe fit was as expected. Since these shoes are made of cloth/canvas, they don't last long. Typically last me a year (of everyday use), but they make up for longevity with comfort. Plus, amazon's price is a lot more discounted. So I'd say, this is a steal.	kaleidoscope	Size: 8 B(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B00K369NJA	/gp/pdp/profile/A2Q0YYZH8L272V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2016/09/17

My friend gifted me a pair of Toms that looked pretty original but were fake and I compared them with these and they are genuine. Even the box is 100% TOMS. The fake ones are nearly worn out but these are still going strong and are super comfortable and of course cute. I love these shoes!

B06W9LJ6W7	Assuming it will not "mold" to my foot like the leather soles	Never had so much difficulty getting my foot into a pair of Toms. Will take a little longer to break in. This has the non-leather sole...which I don't think I am a fan of. It sits higher and makes it harder to get on. Assuming it will not "mold" to my foot like the leather soles..

B06W9LJ6W7	Cute but TOO TIGHT	I have narrow feet and somehow these still are pretty tight! After wearing them for over an hour I have to take them off and step on them as if they were sandals. The elastic band in the middle of the shoe doesn't expand as I wish it did and I end up with marks on my foot of it being so tight. I've had TOMS before and same size were not as tight as these ones. They look pretty but I don't walk with pretty, I need comfort! Don't think I'll purchase another TOMS unless I try them on first.

B06W9LJ6W7	No support	A co-worker has a pair of Toms that she's practically worn through and raved about this brand, so I took the plunge and purchased a pair. Now I'm returning them. Seller was great. Item arrived in perfect conditions (I was a bit nervous as so many reviews mentioned faux shoes). I found these shoes to be very uncomfortable along the top. It would dig into the top of my foot. I also found the toe area to be a bit narrow. No comfort in the footbed itself. I couldn't feel any padding. No arch support. I knew after just taking a few steps that if I wore these to work, my plantar fasciitis would flare up again.

B06W9LJ6W7	Sparkly Toms for work and fun	I get a lot of compliments on these at work. I wear business casual every day and needed relatively comfortable flats as I am on my feet a lot as a nurse practitioner. I bought the same size I usually wear in Toms- they are very consistent. I have narrow feet and like how they fit me. I usually wear nonslip hidden socks with my Toms to keep my feet dry and prevent shoe smellsUPDATE: I STILL wear these at work all the time, especially when I have pants that need a flat shoe in sprinttime. Highly recommend. Have held up well. Shopping for more colors since these are some of the few flats that don't give me blisters but aren't as heavy looking as Merrells for my business casual health care office.

B06W9LJ6W7	Totally Love Them	I've had two pairs before these, both black, and for a very long time. Those pairs of shoes have holes in various places from long-term use. So I thought, "Why not get a different color this time?" So, I fell in love. I feel totally different even though they're the same as my other pairs I've worn out after years and years. They feel very summery to me!I've worn these outside in the rain, in the 100 degree heat, for work, for long walks, and they've stayed put the entire time. The only thing about having a lighter color is that you can see the dirt. I've stepped in mud and putting them in the wash only cleaned part of them.Also, they're definitely more beige than light-grey. They still look great!

B06W9LJ6W7	Light, comfy, but inconsistent sizing	I wouldn't pay full price for Toms, to be honest, but on sale they are my new favorite comfy shoes. They are light and end up molding to your get the more you wear them. The only thing that bothers me is that their sizing is really inconsistent. I've ordered several pairs in the same size and I've found that they've ranged anywhere from a  half size too snug to a full size bigger than marked. Other than that though, I love them.

B06W9LJ6W7	silver glitter wool is great but not very thick or wintery	I ordered the Seasonal Classics Silver Glitter Wool loafer.  They aren't very "woolly" and not lined with anything heavier than regular Toms Classics.  This makes them seem like a shoe to be worn in any season, even summer.  I ordered them in summer so this wasn't a problem at all.  I like these just like every other pair of Toms I've had so far (over a dozen by now).  The pair I received does not seem fake at all.  These are made exactly like all of my other Toms and the sizing is just as expected too.  I fall somewhere between 7-7.5 in most shoes including Toms.  In 7, these shoes feel tight for about 2 wearings and then extremely comfortable.  When I go larger (7.5) they're a bit less secure feeling on my foot and tend to slide around a bit, so I stick with the 7.  However, I find them to be slightly narrow which is perfect for me so you may want to size up if you have a wider foot.

B06W9LJ6W7	Love my lace Toms! Sooo cute!	Love my Lacey Toms! They are a beautiful color and the price was fair! I haven't gotten this style before but I'm a huge fan. They don't have as much give or stretch in the fabric since the lace makes them have more of a stiffness to them, but they are comfortable none the less and I get complimented on how cute they are all the time. I would definitely buy another pair if they were the same price and continue holding up well. I am a very happy customer!	krissyd	Size: 9.5 B(M) US|Color: Raspberry Lace	B00WFCKS7G	/gp/pdp/profile/AKIHEO4T96RNP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/06/24

Toms will hold up fairly well with daily wear, but you have to keep in mind that these aren't finely constructed shoes.

B06W9LJ6W7	Narrow toe box	My only complaint is that I need a wider toe box Than the women's sizes allow. My pinky toe ends up getting rubbed by the seam on the side. I have several pairs of men's size sanuks, and thankfully they have a size 7 in many of the styles that I like. With this women's shoe I bought a size 9 and it looks great, nice but casual, but it does rub my pinky toes.  I still wear them though and they look nice.  If you don't have a wide foot like me then these will work for you.	smt4242	Size: 9 B(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B00K369OSU	/gp/pdp/profile/A6WUHIP1JL2CR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2016/06/05

B06W9LJ6W7	Fits small	I am 9 1/2 size and always wear half size down in Toms.  I ordered these in 9 and they feel a bit tight.  I think it is because of cushioned sole it brings.  First time I see them in Toms (this is my 5th pair).  The soles are veeery confortable but make the shoe fit smaller.  I suggest to buy half size up or remove the sole and wear a thinner one...  This is a very pretty shoe.	MT	Size: 9 B(M) US|Color: Gold	B013D0LRA0	/gp/pdp/profile/A2EEPWKY51E0WL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2016/06/02

B06W9LJ6W7	FakeNgay	Rewriting my review to warn that these are fake!!!  I have since ordered toms from the toms website. The only way I figured out they were fake is when I washed them and they curled. Up into the shape of a C and became completely unwearable! The toms I bought from toms.com washed and came out flat as before the wash. Don't buy from eBay or Amazon if you want them to last.  It's cheaper yes but that's for a reason. Or learn the hard way - that's how I usually do- even after hearing warnings!	anastasia bana	Size: 7 B(M) US|Color: Watercolor Multi	B013ERT2PY	/gp/pdp/profile/AVJ2DWLL2HZJL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	6	1	2016/05/24

B06W9LJ6W7	These are great little shoes	These are great little shoes. Order a size larger, they run small. I went on a trip to Arches National Park in February. I made sure my husband and children all had adequate hiking shoes, but somehow forgot my own. These little Toms were all that I had. They happily carried my over nine miles (according to my pedometer) over rocks and snow. My feet felt just fine at the end of the day and didn't even feel as tired as they usually do after hiking. I would not recommend them for hiking because there isn't very much traction and I had to be really careful on slick rocks and on ice. And I'm kind of surprised that my feet didn't get cold because by the end of the day they were soaking wet from melted snow. But I was able to do everything that my family did! Thank you Toms!

The fabric will stretch within your first wear, but if you buy a bigger size they'll be too big. Even when you first try them on and they're a little tight it's not uncomfortable.I put no arch support because they have flat insides, unlike sneakers which would provide arch support.

B06W9LJ6W7	Awesome shoes	I got the black and white tile print Toms as well as a pair in dark pink. They're both real Toms and fit just like all my other pairs do. What I didn't realize was that the black and white pair is vegan so they have this squishy sort of insert in them rather than the leather that is usually there, which is fine by me but the issue is that the vegan insole comes out when I take the shoes off so that's pretty annoying but after looking on the Toms website I learned that it's supposed to be removable. It's a small annoyance of an otherwise great pair of shoes.

B06W9LJ6W7	Super cute, but needs some modification to be comfortable	These are super cute and a little less casual than regular Toms, which is what I wanted. I ordered my normal size of 8.5. Also of note, I have very wide feet so a lot of "normal" shoes are way too tight for me. Regular Toms usually fit me right out of the box and are pretty much the only closed shoe I can wear all day without being uncomfortable.The lace material does not stretch as well as regular Toms and there is a very spiky/scratchy seam on the inside right where it hits the side of your foot. It was so bad it actually cut up my foot the first day I wore it. There is almost no give the first time you put the shoes on, but they seem to stretch out with time (though much more slowly than regular Toms).To solve the spiky seam problem, I cut a small piece of black grosgrain ribbon and super glued it right over the seam. So far, it has been worlds better. I'm happy because these are more work-appropriate than regular Toms, and I'm hoping they will continue to get more comfortable as I wear them. Before I applied the ribbon, however, they were unwearable for me because the spiky fabric poking into my foot was too painful.

B06W9LJ6W7	Great shoes!	While I have multiple pairs of TOMS shoes, this is the first pair I've purchased in this style. I have to say that I see what all the fuss is about. It's a very lightweight shoe that's warm enough to keep my feet toasty in 45 degree weather in the mornings, but cool enough to let my feet breathe when we hit the 80's in the afternoon. (Crazy NC weather.) And the fact you're helping someone in need with every pair you buy is just icing on the cake.I plan to buy more colors in this style.	nlipford	Size: 9.5 B(M) US|Color: Dark Grey	B010OTT53E	/gp/pdp/profile/A2H5ICV27RHAZP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2016/03/17

B06W9LJ6W7	Fits large and foot slips out	I like the look. However they fit a bit large. I am usually a 6.5. When I tried them on, the size fits, but my heel kept slipping out when I tried to walk. I think it may have to do with the fact that the material is a bit elastic. I will have to return them - considered exchanging for a size 6 but I think they may be too small so I'm not going to bother. Also it seems like they might get dirty easily. They're made of some kind of thick silky string and not more durable synthetic material like I thought.

B06W9LJ6W7	5 like I always do in Tom's Classics and they were ...	It was hard to answer how the product fits because for Tom's Classic shoes I thought they ran a bit smaller than my other classics, perhaps due to the lace not having as much stretch, but, I think Tom's Classics run larger than regular shoes. I usually wear a 9 in other shoes, bought an 8.5 like I always do in Tom's Classics and they were a bit snugger than usual. The shoe is super cute though and I get tons of compliments. They stretched out enough to where I don't think I need a 9.	Mandy M	Size: 8.5 B(M) US|Color: Ink	B00W6A1GQE	/gp/pdp/profile/A2VXXJS6ES0KXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/03/07

B06W9LJ6W7	Runs smalls and is very tight fitting	The shoe was ordered as a present. It is woven black glitter which is really pretty.  TOMS shoes usually fit true to size with some tightness at first.  This shoe runs about a size small. I ordered a 7 and should have ordered a 8.  I am not sure if that would have helped the tightness of the shoe. It was very tight.  I have ordered other TOMS and they fit just fine.

I am wear them all day and my feet wont be sore at all at the end of the day. They go well with any outfit and don't make anything look like I am dressing down. I wear them with jean, dress pants, skirts, dresses, pretty much everything. I bought them as shoes for work, but I actually love them so much that I wear them on weekends too. I don't like wearing heels at all, so I wear these when I go out and have to dress up a little.

Initially the shoes feel good, but eventually (at least if you wear them everywhere, all the time like I did) the arch support starts to flatten down and becomes less supportive. That said, I highly recommend TOM's shoes for comfort and ease, and for quick coordination with other things in your wardrobe. If I didn't live in such a rainy part of the country I would probably wear these everyday, but canvas is not ideal for slogging through constant rain puddles. On vacation in warmer, drier places all of my TOMS have been fantastic.

B06W9LJ6W7	Toms MINT shoes size 9.5W	I am wearing these shoes for my wedding. My colors are mint and gray and I was excited to find them. I think they are a bit on the small size even though I got a half size bigger and also in wide. I normally wear size 9 everywhere else. I have another pair of Toms that are 9 and fit fine. I just don't think the shoe is made very well due to the fact I have only tried them on once and the sole already seems to be coming up from the bottom. I am not going to wear them until my wedding in June, but I have a feeling they will not last long afterwards if I wear them often. They do look just like the picture though	Keirahc13	Size: 9.5 B(M) US|Color: Mint	B00VY3DKC2	/gp/pdp/profile/AALV0LJPCPU1H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2016/01/16

If I get another pair like this, I will go up a half size. But they are made with the quality I expect from Toms and the colors are really nice with this fabric. I hope they will stretch a bit.

B06W9LJ6W7	Great shoe, abnormal fit	I love the shoes! They are super cute and look even cuter in person than they do online. However, I know for a fact that size 7 fits me in TOMS and have ordered all my shoes from this brand in said size. These were the only pair I ordered in size 7 that seem to be a bit larger than they should be. My heel doesn't catch the back of the shoe, so walking is a bit awkward. Other than that they are awesome!	Amazon Customer	Size: 7 B(M) US|Color: White Printed Parrots	B010SGCE2C	/gp/pdp/profile/APF68TXU7WORY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2016/01/15

B06W9LJ6W7	My first TOMS!	And I'm so happy with the selection I made! Reviews are all over the place regarding sizing. I took a gamble. Normally wear an 8, though rarely a 7.5. I got size 7.5 and they're just perfection on my feet. Nice and warm and oh so comfy. I live in heels, so this is an unusual shoe for me. It's large enough to wear with socks, and although there isn't a lot of stretch, there is just enough. I live in a very cold, wet climate, and when the ground is dry and I'm just running errands, this is the show I go to. I've been wearing them daily for about ten days--perhaps longer?--yet they still look brand new. Very cool. I highly recommend these. For me, they are a wonderful non-heel shoe!

B06W9LJ6W7	Kinda bittersweet...	I'm a bit confused with this brand. Prior to this purchase, I bought a TOMS wedge size 7, which is my usual size, and it was way too small. Didn't fit at all. This time around I was determined to get it right so I followed the foot measurement instructions, traced out my foot on paper and all that, and learned my foot is 24 cm which translated to a TOMS size 8. It arrived too big. It seems a 7.5 might've been better. Anyway, I still gave it a rating of 4 stars because the top part of the shoe is snug, thank goodness, so that I can still wear it without it falling off my feet. Another reason is that it's super comfortable straight out the box. The footbed feels divine.  And finally, I've read a few other reviews saying that the shoe wasn't authentic and that it came used... This wasn't my experience. My purchase arrived brand spanking new, an authentic TOMS. I love it, aside from the sizing issue of course.	Fay	Size: 8 B(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B00K369NJA	/gp/pdp/profile/A3IP882OYAW746/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	2	4	2015/11/20

B06W9LJ6W7	Best shoes ever!	I was a little leary about purchasing Toms from a vender here on Amazon. I've always bought my Toms from their website. I'm pleased to say that these are genuine. I absolutely love Toms and own quite a few pair. I've been wearing them for 7 years now. When you purchase, it's ok to order your actual size. They will be a little snug at first, but soon fit like your favorite pair of slippers. I wear them with everything from casual to dressy.

B06W9LJ6W7	Must buy	You never can go wrong with Toms. I normally wear a size 3 in kids in Toms. I ordered mine in a size 5 and they have gotten a little loose from wearing them all day. I would order a size smaller but 5 was the smallest size. I would recommend ordering a size lower because the canvas will stretch. But overall I love them.	madmaxx	Size: 5 B(M) US|Color: Black	B00K369JFS	/gp/pdp/profile/A1NSG3KB6NVNG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/11/01

B06W9LJ6W7	Tight at first, perfect now!	First pair of Toms. At first they were very tight (felt super narrow), so much so that I wasn't sure I'd be able to stand in them all day at work. Broke them in for a couple of hours the night before work and they were great the next day. I have wider feet, so a normal foot may not need this breaking in period. Loved the color and design.

B06W9LJ6W7	Cute, but run smaller than my other Toms.	UPDATE 10/30/2015: Ok, I received the size 7, and while still a bit difficult to get on, they do fit. They're just a little snug but I'm sure these will stretch out. Doesn't change that they're just as comfy as the crochet Toms.10/29/2015: Really cute shoe. Got them in black. I purchased them because I already own the Morocco Crochet Toms which are a really similar style and are comfortable (I have flat feet so I have to insert an arch support to make them more comfortable for me). The sizing is not the same though. My crochets are 6.5, so I ordered these in 6.5 but I couldn't even get them on. It does say that they will stretch with wear, but if I can't get them on there isn't much of a chance. So that's my only issue with them for now. I will be purchasing a 7 in hopes that they will fit better.	Amazon Customer	Size: 6.5 B(M) US|Color: Black	B00THLFSJ6	/gp/pdp/profile/A37XNJMGERELCN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2015/10/29

B06W9LJ6W7	Great wedding reception shoes!	These are my second pair of Toms and although the fit was as expected. There was a tag or a piece of thread that was scraping on my foot that irritated the skin. It was at the seam that was on my big toe, were some people have bunions. (I do not have a bunion, but I can see how this would not be good for someone that does have a bunion.)I bought these to wear for my wedding- I needed something to wear while we were out taking pictures and during the reception. I knew my heels would guarantee pain and discomfort! I only wish that they were ivory instead of white. Most people do not wear bright white dresses, but my dress was long enough that it covered the Toms, so it didn't matter as much.

B06W9LJ6W7	I have high arches so they didn't quite provide the arch support I would like, but overall they were comfortable and worked well	I bought these shoes because I was attending a conference at Walt Disney World that required closed toed shoes.

During the day we were mostly sitting but in the evening I wore these to walk around the parks and although they did start to rub a bit by the end of the day, I didn't get any blisters.

B06W9LJ6W7	Tighter than my typical Tom's	I normally wear a size 9M in the black Tom's, which I have purchased directly from authorized Tom's dealers in the past.  With the Chambray Blue that I ordered from Amazon, a 9.5M was so tight I could not fully slide my foot into the shoe.  I don't know if the chambray material is less stretchy than the black or if the shoe is really a different size, but I was surprised that a supposedly larger shoe should fit so much tighter.As an aside, which did not affect my rating, the insoles are glued instead of sewn to the shoe.  I thought all Tom's insoles were sewn and not removable, so I am not sure if this is an authentic product.  Again, though, I am not sure on this, so it did not affect my rating, but I wanted to point it out for other buyers who may be more informed.

B06W9LJ6W7	Comfortable soles, no arch support	Finally got my first pair of TOMS. I really like the Chambray fabric on these. I love what these shoes stand for, but I don't consider them the most stylish shoes out there. I bought them looking for comfortable, wear-all-day flats. I wore them shopping and after a few hours my feet hurt. The sole of the shoe is comfortable, but there is virtually no arch support. For people with a high arch, these may not be shoes that you wear comfortably all day. I'll continue to wear them out to run errands, but probably not for an all day event or a day full of walking.

B06W9LJ6W7	Great after they are broken in!	I've never had a pair of TOMS but my new job allows the staff to wear more casual clothing so I wanted to try out a few pairs.  I was worried that these would be uncomfortable because they are not made of cotton material.  Well, the first few days I got horrible blisters on my heals and pinky toes. But now, I just put a bandaid on my heal and they are super comfortable all day long.  They take about 3 wears to stretch them out so that they are super comfortable.

B06W9LJ6W7	Comfy and pretty :)	I love this pair! I was intrigued by the idea of a lace shoe, but had never ordered Tom's before, so I was hesitant -- but I look forward to wearing them every day! I have small and wide feet (size 5), and was worried that they would be too tight for me, but they are perfect. Circulation is wonderful, and while I had a few blisters from the material when I first wore them, my skin got used to it quickly; I have no problems with them at all now. I am not sure how durable the lace material is, but I will treat them as best as I can and definitely order another pair when the time comes! I would also love having more colors to choose from -- specifically crimson, burgundy, and dark brown.	konjurer	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A3LS9AIM1Q0GE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/09/20

B06W9LJ6W7	Great summer shoe!	I find these shoes to fit exactly like most other Toms. They are true to size for me. The construction is stronger than more Toms.

B06W9LJ6W7	Sadly, they're way too big...	I LOVE these shoes! I wish I could keep them...not sure what happened, but it's as though the left shoe was a completely different size! I ordered a 9, my regular size, and the right shoe was just a bit too big. Probably could have gone with an 81/2. But the left shoe fell right off my foot as though it was a 10! I could have just exchanged them for the 81/2, but didn't want to risk it again. Such a shame! I really do love these shoes.If you order them and both shoes are the same size, then enjoy! I would recommend them as they are beautiful and seem well made. Not to mention the bonus of what TOMS is all about.

B06W9LJ6W7	Cute and "short-wear" confortable.	I love Toms one-for-one program, helping people in need!  I'd been wanting a pair of the shoes for a long time and finally ordered a pair... the Turquoise multi.  I ordered my usual size of 8.  They were comfortable when I put them on.  I have a high instep so after a couple of hours they started to hurt where the little elastic insert is on top of the shoe.  Because they're cute and pretty comfortable I'm keeping them, hoping the elastic with stretch with wear.  The arch support is good but could be better.

B06W9LJ6W7	Best shoe for all day.	This is my 4th pair of Tom's "Classic" shoes and that means I do love them. They fit true to size. They have a small arch support but I do put "extra" in mine. Tom makes a very comfortable shoe and they work with casual pants, skirts or jean. The 'Classic' is pretty much my "go to shoe". I own two pair of the canvas type and two pair of the wool. Will also add that I wear a size 7 and it seems the cut of this shoe style flatters my large feet!

B06W9LJ6W7	They felt more like a 6 than a 7	I own several pairs of Toms all in the same size.  I purchased these in my usual size and could barely get my foot into the shoe.

They felt more like a 6 than a 7.  Very sad because the I love chambray.	Sydney Prescott	N/A	N/A	/gp/pdp/profile/A2OK3DOJVAI6H9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	1	2015/08/16

B06W9LJ6W7	Strange...	This was my first pair of Tom's, so I wasn't entirely sure what size to order, so I relied on some reviews.. I typically wear a 9-9.5, so I ordered a 9.5 because some reviews had said that it was necessary to go on the larger side with this particular shoe. They were WAY too big, unwearable, as my feet did not even stay in them when I walked. Ok, no problem, I'll return them and get a 9. Well I read some more reviews afterwards claiming that shoes from this seller are fake. I went to go take a closer look at mine and realized they are a 9.5W... Not only did I not order a wide, according to the Tom's website the company doesn't even sell shoes in wide, only medium. So glad I checked, as I was about to go ahead and just order the 9's. Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything from this seller and will definitely go directly through Tom's. Lesson learned.

B06W9LJ6W7	Cute and Comfy Shoe!	I finally succumbed and bought my first pair of TOMS. I was so unsure about the size, since everyone was saying size down and that they stretch. I usually wear and an 8 or 8.5, and was tempted to go for a 7.5. I finally went with the 8. I'm so glad I went wit this size! They fit well, not too tight, not too loose and I like the black on black color, which goes with everything. They don't have much arch support, if any, but they are very comfy for a few hours walking. I wore these while traveling, and on the plane they were perfect. Definitely a worthwhile buy!	myz	Size: 8 B(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B00K369NJA	/gp/pdp/profile/ABKJRI7ZY2JJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2015/08/03

B06W9LJ6W7	Not what i wanted after all	I love Toms shoes and have a few of them i wear regularly.  Was looking forward to these, but ended up returning them after trying them on.  I normally wear a 6.5 or 7, and ordered a 7 as some said they ran tight/small.  The length was fine, width was a little bit tight at front of foot but would have stretched some i'm sure had i kept them.  I just didnt like the opaqueness... i thought the lacy shoe would be more ... lacy (outdoors in sunlight, maybe it would have a bit more of that effect; indoors they looked like i had a black kayak on my foot. I needed black casual flats; these just weren't the ones for me.	C. Simons	Size: 7 B(M) US|Color: Black	B00THLFUVW	/gp/pdp/profile/A18IFGMM7F95PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	3	2015/06/30

B06W9LJ6W7	Great Shoes!	Since I have bought now a total of 5 pairs of Toms shoes for my grandchildren I guess I can be considered an expert on the Classic design at least. I know I could not wear these shoes comfortably, they are light and minimally padded, BUT they are PERFECT for a younger foot, are worn all day every day comfortably by my granddaughters through all sorts of activities and hold up well. I was a tad put off by the price of some of the shoes, I mean really! $50 for canvas slip ons?, however waiting and shopping around through Amazon can net some better prices and using Prime helps too. Regarding the fit - I had bought a couple of pair of these shoes last year for the girls and learned that they fit right on a true size initially but do stretch out with use so now am buying 1/2 size smaller to allow for the stretch.	barbara casabar	Size: 8 B(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B00K369NJA	/gp/pdp/profile/A37G2EW5RNOC75/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2015/06/18

B06W9LJ6W7	Love TOMS	Love these! Very comfortable. This is my second pair of Toms. I have wedge sandals and these. I was advised by the sales lady that Toms stretch the more you wear them, so I  should buy a half size smaller. I'm glad I listened to her. I normally wear a 7.5; both pair of my Toms are size 7. They were just a touch snug(but not uncomfortable) when I bought thm; after just a few wears each pair has stretched and fits perfectly.	luv2shop	Size: 5 F(M) UK / 7 B(M) US|Color: University Navy	B001J6NWZE	/gp/pdp/profile/ABQA4ZT4RJ6YJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2015/05/15

B06W9LJ6W7	Satisfied	I really like these shoes. They are neat. They have a closed toe and heel which is a requirement when we take our dog to the hospital for pet therapy. I had a hard time deciding exactly what size to order. I ordinarily wear a 7 1/2, but I knew these shoes, made of fabric as they are, would probably stretch, and my foot is fairly narrow. So I ordered the 7. At first when I tried them on I thought I had made a mistake, but sure enough they stretched quickly to become quite comfortable. I had seen them on other people and thought they looked good.	Sharon Bond	Size: 7 B(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B00K369M5A	/gp/pdp/profile/A31OPGL3SM2E6R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	3	5	2015/05/08

B06W9LJ6W7	Perfect pair of flats	Perfect pair of flats! The reviews made me iffy because people had reported getting knock-off TOMS from certain buyers. In this case, since Amazon is not TOMS authorized, you have to be careful which seller you are going to use to make your purchase (READ SELLER REVIEWS). But since I got the real deal, I'm very impressed. This is my first pair of TOMS and they are extremely comfortable. I usually wear an 8.5 but I bought a size 9 because I heard about the shoes stretching out. Not a fan of stretching, so I think in most cases, go a size up if you want to avoid a tight fit. This is a shoe you can wear all day. I got these for my restaurant job and they are ideal for someone on their feet for long work shifts.

B06W9LJ6W7	4 starts but beware!!	I've owned the Navy classic rope before and I found it to run a little big because the shoe will stretch with wear, but mainly true to size. I wore my 1st pair into the ground and decided it was time for a new pair. I ordered a 71/2 this time instead of an 8 knowing they will stretch with wear and they were HUGE... Almost a full size too big. I'm not sure if the pair I received was printed wrong, but since I've owned these before, I know they do not run this big. They will unfortunately be going back. Not to mention, the Toms tag on the shoe was already cut off, letting me know these have been returned previously.**I gave the shoe 4 stars because, since I've previously owned them, I know that they are comfortable, super versitale, and go with anything casual! (Rope around bottom does start to shred.. Just something to note) Beware; however, that the NAVY pair I received ran incredibly large..

They are all around the same price nothing is different so don't believe everything you read on reviews.

B06W9LJ6W7	Great shoe	I have a slightly high instep so after getting answers to questions about the fit from other buyers I bought a pair.  The size is perfect, I liked them so much I bought 4 more pairs!  I liked my ballet flats but was realizing that I think my foot is a little wide for the tops of them & they cut into the side of my foot.  So I am happy to have found a shoe that fits.

These aren't meant to run in, or last forever if you do very active thing. Every pair that is purchased, another is given to a child who doesn't have shoes.Toms are worn without socks, and they fit best without socks. They look awesome and are super comfortable for walking in, hanging around the house and doing normal activities in. These fit as expected and are a great color, Recommend to someone who wants to support a good cause, and who wants a stylish, everyday walk around shoe.I do not recommend for someone who is looking for active wear, or a pair of shoes to last a lifetime. These are not that.

B06W9LJ6W7	Not Impressed	I know these shoes have been very popular for many years now; however, this was my first pair. I was only able to wear them for about two months and holes appeared near where my toes sit. The quality is extremely poor. I have narrow feet and I will say the only positive for this pair of shoes is that they did fit and were nice and snug. I won't purchase another pair of these shoes. Very disappointed that there are holes in them for being so new.	SR	Size: 9 B(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B00K369OSU	/gp/pdp/profile/A2HZKAGWL3W3LZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	1	2014/11/29

B06W9LJ6W7	Gift for my Mom	I gave these as a birthday gift to my mom who absolutely loves them!  Some people have difficulty finding the correct size when ordering Tom's online so i'll share this...my mom normally wears a size 8 shoe and i've always purchased her Tom's in a size 8 without downsizing for stretch.  I myself buy my Tom's 1/2 size smaller because i've found that they stretch to the perfect size after a couple days of wearing so deciding on whether or not to buy a 1/2 size smaller is purely preference.These University Ash Slip on's are super adorable in person and are genuine Tom's.  The color is a true ash and the side stripes are a cream color.  As always the purchase was smooth and shipping through Prime was quick.  I highly recommend these cute shoes :)	Kimberly V.

However, the shoes are comfortable enough to wear, plus the design and quality is great so I decided to keep them.Side note: the size 7.5 pair was of a more faded shade of grey than the size 7 even though I ordered them in the same color!	tinybi	Size: 7 B(M) US|Color: University Ash	B005467WDS	/gp/pdp/profile/AH4XO67J9UDUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2014/10/27

B06W9LJ6W7	One for one = One size for each foot	I ordered a size 11, which is my normal size in this brand. My natural size runs around 10.5, and I recommend ordering up to the next whole size for Toms for anyone in a similar in-between situation. Unboxing, this pair initially appeared fine. The color "light grey" was as expected. Both soles said '11'. However, the left shoe seemed unnaturally tight when I tried them on. Being my third pair of Toms, I was surprised. Upon closer inspection, the left shoe was actually a '10' - confirmed by the inner tag. I doubt Tom intended one for one to mean one size for each foot, but that's what I got. Needless to say, if you're questioning the fit, check both sets of tags (insoles and inner arch). Under regular circumstances, you can't go wrong with Toms Classics. They are ultra comfortable and do shape to your foot after a few wears... provided you get two of the same size.	B.

B06W9LJ6W7	Toms Cares About Philanthropy	For these particular shoes, I probably should have gone a half size up from my usual shoe size, as they were a tiny bit snug. Perhaps, since they are canvas, they will stretch out a bit after wearing. I was trying to replace a pair of beloved black canvas slip-ons that I had worn to pieces. The thing that really attracted me to the company, though, was their one for one deal. For every pair of shoes you buy from them, a person in need gets a pair of shoes. The price of the light canvas shoes I purchased was a little high for what they were, but when you consider that you are really paying for two pairs of shoes, it was well worth it. Someone who needs shoes will get a pair. It was easy to do, and I would recommend them highly. I will likely buy more shoes from Toms, and I have already told several people about their one for one policy. Great idea!	C.

B06W9LJ6W7	Sizing	I love the fact that these Toms are wool and lined; however the fit is smaller than the canvas Toms. I wear a size 5 or 5.5 in canvas Toms, so I purchased the 5.5 in the wool lined Toms as I wanted to wear socks with them in the fall and winter. The fit is too snug for socks. I can wear a little footie with them but that's all. I've worn them 3 or 4 times now and they have stretched very slightly. They look cute and well made, but if you plan to wear socks or are between sizes, order a half size up.

B06W9LJ6W7	As always, a comfy shoe from Toms	But, as always, the problem with buying shoes online is the color you see/expect might not be the color it really is.  These looked more like a light to medium gray, which is what I was looking for, but they're a dark brown-ish vs a whitish gray.  I wouldn't call it ash at all, like the standard ash color of gray sweatshirts.  So, that was disappointing, since they're not going to go well with the pants I intended to wear them with.  But they're Toms, so they're comfortable, and that's always a good thing.

B06W9LJ6W7	Love the shoe; larger than normal	I always wear a 7.5 in Tom's.  For some reason, the right shoe was about a size too large, even though it was marked 7.5.  The left shoe was fine.

B06W9LJ6W7	Had to order a whole size smaller than what I usually wear?	I love the look of these shoes, but ended up with a size smaller than I usually wear (a six instead of my usual seven) because in both the 7 and the 6 1/2 my heel kept coming out. Because of the material, the smaller size still fits and the toe part seems like it will probably stretch a bit. I haven't had a chance to wear these more than once, but they're really cute - just seem to run a bit big...	J.

B06W9LJ6W7	Lightweight shoe	A co-worker had a pair that looked great.  I decided to give them a try as spring is finally arriving.  They are a pleasure to wear so far.

B06W9LJ6W7	Great Price for Authentic Toms!	Some people posted that these are not real Toms, but they are the real thing.Since I've bought Toms before I'm aware that they run a little small, for instance, I usually wear a 7 so I ordered these in a 6.5 and they fit perfectly. Also important to note, this style seems a little thicker than the classic Toms, and hopefully a little more resilient to wear and tear.The comfort of these shoes alone definitely makes it a worthy purchase!

B06W9LJ6W7	Very cute	I got lots of compliments on these shoes. They look better without socks and are very comfortable. I usually wear an 8.5, but got a 9 just in case they ran small.

B06W9LJ6W7	Three Season Comfort	I know spring has arrived when I pull out my Toms.  I like the zippy stripes on this style, which jazz them up a bit.  The fit is perfect. I don't expect canvas espadrilles to survive for years, but the blue ones I bought last year should take me through another spring, summer and fall and I expect the same from these.  While they are quite comfortable, they haven't the support needed for extended walking.  I appreciate the fact that for every pair of shoes purchased they donate a pair to charity.

The shoes come with a Toms bag to carry the shoes in, I use it for many other things. I wear these shoes almost everyday and all year long. They aren't ideal for cold weather but I never wear socks.

B06W9LJ6W7	Quality is not what it use to be….	I have ordered four pair of these shoes for my girlfriend and each time the shoes have arrived they are defective.  Insoles are not glued to shoes, Shoes marked with two different sizes on the same shoe.  Soles are not aligned with the shoe properly.  These were her favorite shoe and they are very comfortable and look nice but the quality control over the product has all but disappeared.  Sad for Tom's Shoes… I would rather pay a bit more and get the quality I am use to, then the poor quality they are sending out today.

B06W9LJ6W7	Love my Toms!	I have 18 pair of Toms. I wear a pair every day. I have found for the most part the fit for me is a 1/2 size too big so I order a 7 or 7.5 depending on availability. Will continue to get any new styles that I find attractive!! I have the Classic Rope Slip on in 4 colors!! Love all my Toms!!!

B06W9LJ6W7	Love the shoes, only they need to be broken in (I was warned about this from a friend, who said they tend to stretch).	I wear a size 6.  The shoes are adorable, but a little tight.  However, they seem to be stretching already, and I am recluctant to return them because I like them.  So, I am giving them some time.  I'm not sure if getting a size larger (6-1/2) would work, because they do stretch.	paula boyar	Size: 4 F(M) UK / 6 B(M) US|Color: University Navy	B001J6NWYU	/gp/pdp/profile/A1G2RFPXB2SCV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2013/05/17

B06W9LJ6W7	Awesome, comfortable and cute	This is my first pair of Toms - and it won't be my last. They are comfortable and cute and go with a lot. I usually wear a 7.5 (and occasionally an 8), but I took other poster's advice and sized down to a 7 and it fits well. It needed to "stretch" over a few days, but it wasn't that bad. Love them!	C.

B06W9LJ6W7	Too wide!	I love these shoes, but the ones I got were too wide. They fit perfectly in the toe, and they're the size of Toms I usually get.

B06W9LJ6W7	Fantastic Shoes!!	I love Toms, I own many pairs. I wanted a pair that would provide a nice pop of color. These are perfect. Usually I get a size 7.5 in Toms but I went a half size down in these because it was all that was available and they fit like a dream! Toms always stretch just a bit so it wasn't too bad breaking them in. The corduroy is soft and hasn't worn off at all, and I wear these ALL the time.	sara saylor	Size: 7 B(M) US|Color: Plum	B008OMP8QC	/gp/pdp/profile/A3UCXYNNQF7CRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	5	2013/04/26
B06W9LJ6W7	These are great shoes	I bought these Tom's shoes first and foremost because a pair of shoes will be given to a needy child when one is purchased for personal use.

The espadrille design was also an added treat.The shoes fit great, are comfortable, and look good on my feet.I highly recommend them.	ljschloss	Size: 6 F(M) UK / 8 B(M) US|Color: University Navy	B001J6NWZY	/gp/pdp/profile/A1ZH476HF9PWB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	5	2013/04/12

B06W9LJ6W7	Comfort & Style	First, buying a pair of TOMS just makes you feel good - one for one.  As with the other 3 pair bought previously, these are comfortable and stylish, and they compliment a preppy look quite well.  I find them consistently true to size.  And to me, these say "welcome summer and a hot day by the shore."  I have my American flag scarf (also an Amazon purchase), and I'm ready for the July 4th celebration.

B06W9LJ6W7	They're nice, but don't last long	I had always loved TOMS, but after two pairs I don't think I'll buy them again. Though they are light and I like their concept of buy one, give one, these shoes barely last me one summer. I don't know if I just walk hard on them (I doubt it, I'm only 5'1" and under 100 lbs), or if they just aren't made to last, but I only got to wear them for one season and then had to throw them out because I had worn through the sole.

B06W9LJ6W7	Very Comfortable	I purchased these shoes for a friend who has difficulty finding comfortable shoes because of the width of her feet. She reported back that the Toms have been extremely comfortable. In addition to regular use, they were worn one day doing a variety of things - short distance walking; driving; cleaning a garage which required stooping, lifting and carrying heavy items. Also for every pair purchased, the company donates one pair of shoes to a child in need. So you get a good looking, comfortable pair of shoes and know you are helping someone else.

B06W9LJ6W7	A Toms terrific shoe.	If you are reading this review, chances are good you know the Toms story.  But for those of you who do not know, Toms donates a pair of shoes for every pair bought.  They are typically comfortable slip on shoes.  These are no exception.  The corduroy adds an unusual and nice touch.  It isn't every day that guilty pleasure comfy shoes are presentable for work, but these have a cut and styling that will pass the test with pants.  And they are very comfortable.  The cloth construction gives in all the right places, while the seams hold the shape.  Love them.

B072JTFZLY	Really great shoes	These shoes are so much more comfortable than the past pairs of vans I have had, because of the heel padding that prevents my heels from slipping and causing blisters. They go great with any outfit and I love the classic stripe that adds some style. For size, I ordered according to the official vans size chart and measured the length in cm, and it was very true to size. These are a casual and comfortable shoe that I would definitely recommend to anyone.

B072JTFZLY	Excellent shoes for weightlifting	I LOVE these shoes. First of all, I purchased them fro weightlifting. Converse all-stars seem to be the go-to shoe for most weightlifters, but they are far too narrow for me. I don't usually buy wide width, but Converse are really narrow. These shoes fit perfectly; they are very comfortable. They have the flat non-compressible sole that I was looking for. Not only that, but I noticed that the converse that I tried had some sort of felt on the bottom (so they don't squeak, maybe?) which made them slide on hard flooring. In contrast, the Vans have a rubber bottom that gets great traction. This makes me feel so much more stable when lifting weights.I was also a little surprised by how cute they are; I may just wear these outside of the gym too!

B072JTFZLY	Amazing shoes so far	Amazing shoes so far, wasn't able to try on this exact model. They fit better than the Old Skool with the suede toecap to me at least out of the box. It's a really soft leather, that has a really interesting pattern. I thought it was a little bit more of a shiny leather, with a bit of matte, but it's way more matte, with little shine showing off the texture of the leather. Basically if looks could kill, I'd be in trouble. Honestly depending on what you're going for, and where you work you can pull these off for anything. If you're in a work casual environment these would be an easy fit, and don't scream skater boi. On that note I'm really not sure if these would be the shoes to do it in. I assume they're built the same as the Old Skool, but it's canvas lined leather, that's really supple. I'm sure a couple of kickflips would rip these things to shreds, but again I don't think they're meant for that. Again, great shoes, will update as they wear.

B072JTFZLY	BUYER BEWARE!!	I was shocked at how poor the quality was. I have been wearing Vans since 1995, and have been a loyal customer due to the high quality. After seeing these shoes I was ready to write Vans off as another company that squandered quality for profit, but instead, I decided to take the shoes I received and travel an hour away to an authorized Vans retail location at which I was able to compare the shoes I received to the same model and size they had in stock. After comparing several features, it was determined that the shoes I received were "knock-off" faux Vans. Fakes. Not real.... the bar code on the box was even bogus. If you receive these shoes, and the quality seems lacking, I would recommend going to an authorized Vans retailer, and comparing. The shoes I received felt like they would fall apart after several months of wear, whereas the shoes I replaced them with from the Vans store feel like they'll last years. Buyer beware!!!	Megan M.

B072JTFZLY	Color is deceiving	The only problem here is that the color doesn't look quite like the picture. The sole and stripe are a lot lighter than in the picture. Looked like a black sole and stripe and a grey shoe. When in fact the stripe and sole are a slightly darker grey than the rest of the shoe. I looked on the vans website and they are the same way, in fact the stripe and sole looked even darker there. I used my own camera (iPhone) to snap a photo and in fact got the same darker sole and stripe in my own photo. So it must just be that color acts weird to a camera. You can kind of see my photo the grey isn't as dark but it still looks darker in my photo than it really is. So wasn't what I had in mind, black and grey. They will be returned.

B072JTFZLY	FAKE! DO NOT BUY	The shoes are a very good replica of the real sneaker. But the giveaway signs that this shoe was fake was the simple brown box that it came in, which did not let me see the serial number. Also, on the VANS website, it states that the Van's old skool consists of a SUEDE AND CANVAS UPPER. This shoe did not consist of ANY SUEDE at all. Also the shoe's side of the soles has already worn out after 2-3 uses. Do not buy for the price they are selling for. The seller even comments "the shoe is 100% authentic. This is a lieTHIS IS A FAKE SHOE.	Amazon Customer	Size: 8.5 D(M) US|Color: Black/True White	B005B03ISA	/gp/pdp/profile/A8WRGGB4E1OZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	11	1	2016/12/21

This style is a little different fitting than the authentic that I usually wear. They lace right up to the ankle which makes your foot look kind of long, but the overall shoe is awesome.

B072JTFZLY	Such a waste of money. Try on before you buy.	I have been wearing vans for many years and normally wear sk8 hi's // I tried them on and they felt fine, over the course of an hour these tore up the back of my heel. (Like not even a blister, a huge chunk of my skin ripped off) They also don't seem to be made as nice as my other vans that I have bought from actual retail stores.  I can't return them since I wore them, unfortunately they will just be tossed in the trash. Such a waste of money.

B072JTFZLY	Great shoes as long as you add your own insoles for arch support	I love these shoes for the way they look and generally fit. They look really fantastic, and can match things that are anywhere from black to grey to tan.The one star off is because I have high arches and a bad back, so while they're fantastic with my orthodic insoles slipped in, I imagine the very thin insoles they have glued into them would not be very comfortable.However, going half a size up, at least the insoles in these shoes are thin enough that I can fit my orthodic insoles in on top of them. This is a big bonus, as I can't really wear shoes without those. So if you're someone who adds insoles, know that while the insoles in these Vans are so thin that you can probably fit your insoles in on top of them and still fit your foot in the shoes, unless your feet are very wide or thick perhaps.

Perfect fit for my hard to fit (yet delicate ;) ) feet! The first time I wore them was to work on casual Friday; it was a busy day at the office and I was on my feet a lot, but my Vans were solid.

I still love them, but I stick to the all canvas old skools now because the seem to accommodate a little wider foot more comfortably. Overall, these are vans and I love them still. Got what I was expecting!	Whatshisface	Size: 12 D(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B001IDQ4Q2	/gp/pdp/profile/A2EYTQ9ESR07XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	4	2016/09/01

B072JTFZLY	Great shoe as always.	These shoes are great as always.  The only thing with Vans is the arch support is lackluster.

Overall a great shoe.  I would buy them again.	R.

B072JTFZLY	Decent.	This was a decent shoe. The all black color is nice. I wear a 10.5 in men’s; the shoe fit nice though it was a little wide by maybe half a centimeter. Like in other reviews I have experienced some small blisters on the very back of the ankle area. It’s not a horrible problem but it is something to think about when purchasing this shoe. Even considering this it is a very comfortable shoe. I wear it 8 to 14 hours a day and other than very small blisters there are no other issues with them.I would recommend it to a friend who wants a light, stylish and comfortable shoe that doesn’t cost that much.

The shoes are great, they look fantastic, and they were almost completely worth the money. The only bad thing about the shoes is that the shoe, where the back of the ankle is, rubs aggressively on the skin and it hurts. Other than that, everything is great.

B072JTFZLY	The grey ones are narrower than the other colors	I have been wearing vans old skool shoes for 10 years or so.  Many times I would go into a store and buy them without trying them on because I have always worn a size 11.  These are two narrow, this is the first pair of grey ones I have ever bough but that shouldn't matter.  So I bought a second pair thinking it was a fluke, now I have two pairs in the closet that don't fit.	ryan j murray	Size: 11 B(M) US Women / 9.5 D(M) US Men|Color: Black Pewter	B003S0U3VA	/gp/pdp/profile/A1KSHQPJ3MQ5L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	N/A	3	2016/01/18

B072JTFZLY	these shoes are very comfortable. They used to be a great value	I've been wearing these sneakers for decades. I wear them frequently, and a pair would last me about a year before they needed replaced. Everytime I order them, the price has gone up a bit. The price for them has nearly doubled in the last several years. The last pair I purchased started to fall apart after a month or 2. I've been a diehard Vans fan for a long time. After a short break-in period, these shoes are very comfortable. They used to be a great value, but sine their prices have gone up, and quality down, they have lost me as a customer. I am disappointed to say that I no longer would recommend them to anyone. They need to make their prices reasonable and bring their quality back up before they will see me again.

B072JTFZLY	Retro-ish kicks	My favorite sneakers these days I think. I like the monotone retro-ish look. I don't skate, but these still get beat up fairly quickly biking (I apparently abuse shoes as well). The biggest downside of these shoes is that the more disgustingly beat up they look on the outside, the more comfortable they become -- so if you see folks wearing these shoes and they look like they are about to fall off their feet, you'll now know why. ;-)Also, they aren't Converse, which are sadly (and have been for several years now) owned by Nike.	r t n	Size: 11 D(M) US|Color: Black/Black	B000X8QTF4	/gp/pdp/profile/A3PA0GQGZH42HV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	1	4	2015/06/16

B072JTFZLY	Still Can's Skate	I bought these because my son and his friends all wear them and they are great skateboarders.  I assumed that if I too had these shoes that I would be able to skate like them.  Well, it has been 4 days and my skate skills are literally identical to as they were before I had these shoes.  I do have more "skate cred" as they look kick-ass.  If you are looking for cool kicks that are super-comfy, these are great.  If you are looking to improve your skate skills, I guess you should take lessons or maybe practice more...

B072JTFZLY	Wearing Out More Quickly Than Previous Pairs	This is only my second pair of Vans, but the first pair lasted MUCH longer. These (same style, same size) are wearing quickly, breaking at the rubber section where my toes bend. This is a common "weak spot" in shoes, but my first pair had no such problems. They're still getting the job done, but these will have to be replaced sooner than the last pair (lasted 2 years until I wore through the soles).

B072JTFZLY	Size variation from shoe to shoe?	I bought these for my nephew last Christmas because he had a similar pair (in black and gray) in a size 11. He and his mom told me he was getting too big for the 11s, so I bought these in a 12 thinking they'd be plenty big enough since he was still wearing his 11s, but I was wrong. He had to exchange them for a different pair. Why in the world would a different pair of Vans be smaller than a very similar pair in a smaller listed size? I did check to make sure the pair I received was a 12, so why would they fit him like a size 10 of the shoes he already had? Seems stupid.	Mary P.

B072JTFZLY	Don't let the look fool you...	Okay, so basically I am very disappointed in this purchase. They feel cheap, and they are NOT comfortable. However, if you do feel the need to buy them anyway, let me warn you of a few things.The heel will gouge the back of your foot to oblivion, and the laces are about twice as long as they need to be. So for people who actually tie their shoes, like me, this is a nightmare. Plus, the laces are so shoddy anyway that in the second week of wear they start fraying and become increasingly difficult to work with.I don't know how this happened. The last pair of Vans I owned were remarkable and I was so excited to be getting another pair. I am deeply frustrated with these shoes.PROS:AffordableThey look awesomeI don't feel bad about getting them dirtyThey break in eventually...CONS:VERY uncomfortableCheap materials and even worse lacesProbably not worth $50	Zach Conaway	Size: 11 B(M) US Women / 9.5 D(M) US Men|Color: Black Pewter	B003S0U3VA	/gp/pdp/profile/A3LFCGAH3GF7P9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8	21	2	2013/04/17

B072JTFZLY	Confusing	I had no problem with the quality of the shoe, my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing.  I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women, but it turned out the other way around.  I have tor return these.  You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes.

B072JTFZLY	Shoes are awesome!	I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here.  These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!

B072JTFZLY	Very comfortable shoe	My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.	Janice M.

B072JTFZLY	awesome shoes	i had a pair of these that i wore for many years until they were literally falling apart. i loved them so much, i really wanted the same shoes again. i found these and was really excited! they are a bit more snug that the old ones, but i'm sure that's because they're brand new. i love them, just like i did with my old pair. they have a really cool retro skate style and are comfy. i'm very pleased.
